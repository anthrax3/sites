Chapter：01<br>
[ideal]<br><br>

IKARUGA is gone......<br>
Though they are persecution, they will rise up.<br>
Because they have the firm will to live.<br><br><br>


Chapter：02<br>
[Trial]<br><br>

As your will is firm, you suffer from many trial.<br>
It goes without saying that you can avoid and escape from the trial.<br>
But the true meaning of trial is to overcome such your weakness.<br><br><br>


Chapter：03<br>
[Faith]<br><br>

There is not absoluteness in this world, and so you may be quite at a loss since you encountered with unreasonableness.<br>
You must have a firm faith, an insight, and some power of action, to overcome such a situation.<br><br><br>


Chapter：04<br>
[Reality]<br><br>

Reality is come in sight.<br>
What did you seek for......?<br>
What did you see......?<br>
What did you hear......?<br>
What did you think......?<br>
What did you do......?<br><br><br>


Chapter：05<br>
[Metempsychosis]<br><br>

Before long by one destiny, the will shall be returned and you shall be remembered the memory of origin.<br><br>

Because of that, IKARUGA is gone......<br><br><br><br>

<hr color="#ffffff"><br><br><br><br>


<i>

I gave you lives.<br><br>

So that you make good progress.<br><br>

But you couldn't understand?<br><br><br><br><br>



Although you can't feel visible matter,<br><br>

do you think that you can feel invisible matter?<br><br><br><br><br>


You can understand?<br><br>

You can never sever this metempsychosis eternally.<br><br><br><br><br>

Because of that, go through with it not to regret.<br><br>

"I don't die not to live. I don't yield if my wish does not fulfilled. I never die with regret."<br><br>

I could understand......"Can we be set at liberty?"<br><br><br><br><br>



"You released a control device of IKARUGA. After this, you can't use a machine gun of IKARUGA."<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>




"We were allowed to do that?"<br><br><br><br><br>


"Yes, we were. I believe the day when we understand ourselves and live together would come."<br><br><br><br><br>


"And then, life will be inherited in the future."<br><br>
