            When love becomes intense, pressing with the nails or scratching the body with them is practised, and it is done on the following occasions: On the first visit; at the time of setting out on a journey; on the return from a journey; at the time when an angry lover is reconciled; and lastly when the woman is intoxicated.

            Here Suvarnanabha says that while a man is doing to the woman what he likes best during congress, he should always make a point of pressing those parts of her body on which she turns her eyes.

            The lovers may also sit on the terrace of the palace or house, and enjoy the moonlight, and carry on an agreeable conversation. At this time, too, while the woman lies in his lap, with her face towards the moon, the citizen should show her the different planets, the morning star, the polar star, and the seven Rishis, or Great Bear.

            This list is comprehensive of how a submissive part in a relationship would behave. Of course, she's in it for the money, but I can't help but wonder why there is no allowance for a stronger partner. Simply the mood of the author or culture?

In my culture, the more equal partnership is presumed. There is a disgust at the kind of submission written within. However, I wonder how changed the egos of men are? As far as a contemporary courtesans' behavior goes, I'd be shocked if it was so different.

Which then leaves me wondering if a household with this kind of submissiveness is a happier one for a male? Certainly, one with a dominent female is less common in the social conciousness-- such a state would almost be license for divorce or adultry.

Are we happier that the gradient has widened from one side only?

            as dough is prepared for baking, so must a woman be prepared for sexual intercourse, if she is to derive satisfaction from it.
