            Sound filled the room, a crystal melody that could lift any human heart and turn away any devil. It was “Here I Go Again” by Whitesnake.

            Jennifer put up her hands, said, “Guys, let’s not make this a dick-measuring contest, okay?” There was silence for a moment, then John said, “That’s good, because it wouldn’t be no contest at all.” Silence again. “That is, I’m referring to my cock being bigger than either of yours.” I sighed and said, “John, I don’t think anyone in this vehicle is in the mood to—” “John, let me make one thing clear,” Jim said, cutting me off in his most stern, evangelical voice. “Every man is blessed with his gifts from the Lord.

            He paused to let his eyes flick to mine and Amy’s wet hair and presumably asked himself if our showers had overlapped in any way. He was too polite to ask.
