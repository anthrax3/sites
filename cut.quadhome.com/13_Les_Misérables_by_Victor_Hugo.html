            The mayor of the town came to receive him at the gate of the town, and watched him dismount from his ass, with scandalized eyes. Some of the citizens were laughing around him. &quot;Monsieur the Mayor,&quot; said the Bishop, &quot;and Messieurs Citizens, I perceive that I shock you. You think it very arrogant in a poor priest to ride an animal which was used by Jesus Christ. I have done so from necessity, I assure you, and not from vanity.&quot;

            How different our world. The characters of P.G. Wodehouse's stories often relied upon the current or future support of relatives. Where in modern times, the idea of inheritance is a bit aristocratic. Is the change one of more accessible wealth, more general social support, or less regard for future generations?

            One may feel a certain indifference to the death penalty, one may refrain from pronouncing upon it, from saying yes or no, so long as one has not seen a guillotine with one's own eyes: but if one encounters one of them, the shock is violent; one is forced to decide, and to take part for or against. Some admire it, like de Maistre; others execrate it, like Beccaria. The guillotine is the concretion of the law; it is called vindicte; it is not neutral, and it does not permit you to remain neutral.
