		<h1>Be Right Back</h1>

		<p> Hi, </p>

		<p> I'm healthy, safe, and taking care of myself! </p>

		<p>
			You've received this letter because you may be
			wondering why I've disappeared. I feel lucky for our
			mutual experiences unto this point; but, I need to
			focus on my priorities.
		</p>

		<p>
			It's my truest hope that we can resume our relationship
			when I'm more stable.
		</p>

		<p> Until then, all my best, </p>

		<p> Scott Robinson </p>

		<h2> Postscript: How to contact </h2>

		<p>
			There are two ways to contact me, with two separate
			rules of engagement:
		</p>

		<p>
			The first is via text message or email. I read these;
			but, I won't reply unless the topic is either relevant
			to my current focus or a life-and-death emergency.
		</p>

		<p>
			The second is via voice or video call. Calls are
			scheduled via text message or email and must follow a
			prearranged agenda.
		</p>
