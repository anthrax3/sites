      <p><i>Hourai</i> was once a small nation at the end of the mainland.
     But now, this nation calls itself <i>Jintuusya</i>. Wielding the the
 <i>power      of God</i>, <i>Hourai</i> conquers other nations through military
power.   </p>
                                                                        
         
      <p>In the beginning, <i>Stone-like</i> was dug up from  the    ground 
by <i>Hourai-Tenrou</i>. <i>Hourai-Tenrou</i> is the ruler of       <i>Hourai</i>. 
      <i>Hourai-Tenrou</i>   has performed miracles since she  encountered 
      <i>Stone-like</i>. </p>
                                                                        
         
      <p>Opposing <i>Hourai</i>, there was <i>Tenkaku</i>, a resistance group
defending     liberty and resisting <i>Hourai</i>. They use fighter planes
called        <i>Hitekkai</i>  and fight against <i>Hourai</i>. But the <i>Tenkaku</i>
   lost   their power and were annihilated. </p>
                                                                        
         
      <p>However, miraculously one young man named <i>Shinra</i> survived.<br>
               </p>
                                                                       
      <p><i>Shinra</i> fought against <i>Hourai</i> again by himself, but 
    he was shot down and crashed at the remote <i>village of Ikaruga</i>. 
The       village is composed of old people, ignored and renounced<a
 href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a> by <i>Hourai</i>.   <i>Shinra</i> was helped 
by old <i>Kazamori</i> and the other old people.       </p>
                                                                        
                   
      <p>   <i>Shinra</i> recovered completely and informed the villagers
 that he would     fight   against <i>Hourai</i> again. The villagers gave
 the <i>Ikaruga</i> to <i>Shinra</i>. </p>

      <p><i>Hourai</i> - ñPóà - A real town in Japan. Literally translated
as "the coming male    mythical bird." This falls in line with the bird motif
 throughout the  game.</p>
                                                                         
     
      <p><i>Jintuusya</i>  - ê_í é“ - The personification of a supernatural
power.  There is a lot of kanji crossover with the "supernatural powers"
of Buddhism.  I imagine this isn't unintentional since <i>Hourai</i>, in
the game, is a  Buddhist theocracy.<br>
        </p>
               
      <p><i>the power of God</i> - ê_ÇÃóÕ - More likely better translated as
 the "force of God."<i><br>
        </i></p>
                                                                         
     
      <p><i>Stone-like - </i>éYìyê_â©ãPÉmâÚ - This   can't be directly translated 
into English. A literal reading is "stone of the   shining golden guardian 
diety of one's birthplace." Thankfully, it's already   been officially translated 
as <i>Stone-like</i>.<br>
                </p>
                                                                        
                                                                     
      <p><i>Hourai-Tenrou</i> - ìVòO - Literally translated as "heavenly tower".
     Likely it has a relation to Garuda (âﬁòOóÖ), the man-bird deity of Hindu-Buddhist
     myth.<br>
               </p>
                                                                       
      <p><i>Tenkaku</i> - ìVäp - The first kanji represents "Heavenly" and "Imperial".
    (The Japanese Imperial line is backed by divinity.) The second kanji
is   loaded  with meanings! The literal meaning is "corner" or "angle" giving
 the imagery  of a dissident group. However, since I'm an uncultured American,
  I'll weasel  out with the translation of "Imperial Resistance."</p>
                                                                       
      <p><i>Hitekkai</i> - îÚìSâÚ - Literally translated as "flying iron lump." 
I'm     not joking.<br>
               </p>
                                                                       
      <p><i>Shinra</i> - êXóÖ - A literal translation refers to the inter-connectedness 
    of nature and the world. However, a literal pronounciation lends itself 
  to  a lot of <a
 href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/breen/wwwjdic?1MUJshinra">double 
    meanings</a>.<br>
           </p>
                                       
      <p><i>Village of Ikaruga</i> - î¡îµÇÃó¢<br>
        </p>
               
      <p><sup><a name="note-1"></a>1</sup> - I wasn't able to improve upon 
the original translation. I can't tell if they were exiled or just ignored. 
Update with clarification coming soon!<br>
       </p>
               
      <p><i>Kazamori</i> - ïóéÁòVêl - Literally translated as "wind's elderly 
nursemaid."</p>
       
      <p><i>Ikaruga</i> - î¡îµ - Literally translated as a <a
 href="http://homepage1.nifty.com/bird-edu/eng/jn_gros.html">Japanese grosbeak</a>.
 (black and white bird) Also a Japanese <a
 href="http://www.town.ikaruga.nara.jp/">town</a> with a rich history. One
 historical anectode of importance is Horyuji Temple, in Ikaruga, was ordered
 built by Prince Shotoku. Prince Shotoku played a major role in importing
and promoting Buddhism in Japan.<br>
