<kung_fu_mike> I just found out I am not a father
<Slant> http://tranzoa.net/~scott/mp3/mike-police.mp3
<evenpar123> I'm not following any of this
<evenpar123> what the heck is going on?
<Slant> evenpar123: 1) Mike screwed this ugly chick
<Slant> 2) Ugly chick had baby.
<Slant> 3) Ugly chick said Mike's condom broke and baby was his.
<Slant> 4) Ugly chick said she hadn't been properly laid since Mike.
<Slant> 5) Thus, Baby is Mike's.
<Slant> 6) Mike starts giving cash up and being poor for this baby.
<Slant> 7) Bitch gets free stuff. Bitch has crazy Mom.
<Slant> 8) Mike asks for paternity test.
<Slant> 9) Bitch whines.
<Slant> 10) Bitch gets it anyway.
<Slant> 11) [a few months go by]
<Slant> 12) Paternity test says "1.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001% chance of Mike being this baby's parent.
<Sam|foo> actually there's only a one in 10 thousand chance mike is the father now
<Slant> 13) Mike says "peace nigga!"
<Slant> 14) Bitch whines at Mom because she wants more money.
<Slant> 15) Crazy Mom "calls" lab, lawyer, doctor, and Budda.
<aphxero> Greedy a$$ bitchez nowadays. psh. shoooot!
<Slant> 16) Crazy Mom calls Mike and cops.
<Sam|foo> Step 15 was done at like 8 pm
<Slant> 17) Scott records voice mail for posterity.
<evenpar123> <applause>
<Sam|foo> Lab = closes at 5 pm
<Sam|foo> www.genelex.com
<evenpar123> Like a sitcom
<FlipTopBox> 18) Scott puts voicemail on Morpheus, WinMX, and KaZaA for dissemination
<aphxero> jerry! jerry! jerry!
<evenpar123> but I don't get the significance of the lab being closed
<Sam|foo> Lawyers = none in Pullman open this late
<Sam|foo> Sam's letter:
<Sam|foo> Date: Thu, 17 Jan 2002 21:21:59 -0800 (PST)
<Sam|foo> From: Samuel John Gibson <samgib@mail.wsu.edu>
<Sam|foo> To: crazybitch@aol.com
<Sam|foo> Subject: Zackary
<Sam|foo>
<Sam|foo> Jesika,
<Sam|foo>
<Sam|foo> Here are a few links from the lab's website that you might find useful in
<Sam|foo> your dilemna at this point, first to see the accuracy of the test is this
<Sam|foo> site:
<Sam|foo>
<Sam|foo> http://www.genelex.com/paternitytesting/paternitygood.html
<Sam|foo>
<Sam|foo> About halfway through the page it points out that it is OVER 99.99%
<Sam|foo> accurate. Not only that but they have a standard more than a hundred times
<Sam|foo> stricter than that of the rest of the industry. That means that there is
<Sam|foo> less than a one in a ten thousand chance that the test is incorrect. Also,
<Sam|foo> since your mother questioned the validity of the test, I would like to
<Sam|foo> point out that it is notarized by a Washington State certified notary
<Sam|foo> (Robert J. Giddings) that the doctor who performed the test was the one
<Sam|foo> who signed it. Meaning that it could not have been forged by Mike.
<Sam|foo> them tell you the test needs to be redone. FURTHERMORE, medical records
<Sam|foo> cannot be accessed, and test answers cannot be retrieved unless the party
<Sam|foo> confirms his identity as that of the one being tested. Meaning you could
<Sam|foo> not have asked them about the test.
<Sam|foo>
<Sam|foo> Check here for the open hours of Genelex Co. (8am-5pm):

<Sam|foo>
<Sam|foo> Since you seem to question the lack of a percentage presented on the test
<Sam|foo> let me explain it to you. If you look at the paper that you have you will
<Sam|foo> see in the middle; three columns. The furthest left column is the medical
<Sam|foo> names of the genes that were tested; this is largely irrelevent for our
<Sam|foo> purposes. The second column is Zackary's genotype, or the alleles (halves
<Sam|foo> of genes) that he posses for that gene (each parent contributes one
<Sam|foo> allele, resulting in two). The next column is that of Mike;s genotype, and
<Sam|foo> the final column tells whether the combination is possible or not.
<Sam|foo> If you would actually like to call them for real...between buisness hours
<Sam|foo> here is the toll free number:
<Sam|foo> 1 800 523-3080
<Sam|foo>
<Sam|foo> I personally am hurt and aghast that someone could try to ruin another's
<Sam|foo> life with such ferocity as you have done with Mike, even after the
<Sam|foo> affirmation that he is not the father of your child. I suggest that you
<Sam|foo> look at your situation before attempting to pursue this matter any
<Sam|foo> further. The fact that Mike is allowing you to keep the things he
<Sam|foo> purchased for Zack, and child support that he has already paid to you
<Sam|foo> should be reason enough to leave the matter as is. If you were to pursue
<Sam|foo> this any further (in say...a legal sense) you would risk losing that.
<Sam|foo> Since the paternity affidavit was signed, and then recinded within the
<Sam|foo> contestable period of time, Mike is not the father in a legal OR a
<Sam|foo> genological sense.
<Sam|foo>
<Sam|foo> Best wishes with your future life,
<Sam|foo> -Sam Gibson

<evenpar123> Mike must be ethnic, cause I see a lot of exclusion going on there
