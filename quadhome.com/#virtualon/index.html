&lt;Slant&gt; Sam would, at this moment, be making some sort of joke about the &quot;Hani incidents&quot;. Probably something like &quot;What about you, Mr. Suprised-By-Titties?!?!&quot;
&lt;Slant&gt; and then he would whack me with a &quot;fresh trout.&quot;
&lt;FlipTopBox&gt; Hani?
&lt;Slant&gt; Yay, you never heard. I think I'll allow Sam to relay the story because I've had enough embar<b>ass</b>ment about it.
&lt;Slant&gt; Suffice to say I was very much in position to gain play, but I just didn't know it.
&lt;FlipTopBox&gt; i see.  be like me, and learn to predict. ;-)
&lt;friction&gt; That was my biggest problem too for many years.
&lt;friction&gt; Haha, the Yomi method Tom?
&lt;FlipTopBox&gt; Yomi dating.

&lt;evenpar123&gt; What would the mature response be? Hand out flowers and pamphlets explaining WHY terrorism is bad to the people in Palastine who are dancing in the streets? Sounds like a good idea. How about you be the first?

</pre>

<hr>

<pre>

&lt;Cacophanus&gt; So you guys are *not* interested in an online arcade game where you can play opponents all over the world?

&lt;Cacophanus&gt; ...okay, just pervert then ^_-

</pre>

<hr>

<pre>

&lt;Slant|Black&gt; Cacophanus has made me hot. I think I might have to break my &quot;no masturbation with my twin sticks on school nights&quot; rule.
&lt;Mechaman&gt; heh. y'know, I can actually get a disturbing mental picture of that.
&lt;Slant|Black&gt; Mechaman: For reference, I have a 19 inch penis.
&lt;Slant|Black&gt; Unless I'm giving my twin sticks a handjob
&lt;Kat_Ears_Kahrain&gt; i need a gun loaded with a soap bullet to clean my brain now
&lt;Slant|Black&gt; in which case you have it all wrong
* Mechaman/#sydvoc makes the appropriate corrections.
&lt;Mechaman&gt; Hm, my frontal lobe appears to be staging a revolt now.
&lt;Mechaman&gt; I hate when that happens.

&lt;MentholMoose&gt; I think turbovec was the gateway idiot that prepared me for people like albaster
&lt;Slant&gt; MentholMoose: He's the marijuana of idiots.
&lt;MentholMoose&gt; my thoughts exactly
&lt;Slant&gt; albaster is the hard crack.
&lt;Slant&gt; My arms are just about tapped. I think I'm going to have to start shooting Flyer through my toes.
&lt;evenpar123&gt; we hate Flyer?
&lt;MentholMoose&gt; eh not really hate
&lt;MentholMoose&gt; just don't mind mocking
&lt;Slant&gt; It's like this:
&lt;Slant&gt; Xypher_ZX, X-Dorkas, Flyer, Zaku II, Turbovec, albaster.
&lt;Slant&gt; I feel there should be something between Turbovec and albaster though.
&lt;Slant&gt; Xypher_ZX, X-Dorkas, Flyer, Zaku II, Turbovec, Usama bin Laden, albaster.
