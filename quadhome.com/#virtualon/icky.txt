<Slant> FlipTopBox: Girls are icky.
<FlipTopBox> hey all
<FlipTopBox> icky, eh?
<Slant> 100% super-duper icky.
<FlipTopBox> hehe
<FlipTopBox> and why is that?
<Slant> Because they are.
<Slant> :-)
<Slant> I haven't decided on a reason yet.
<FlipTopBox> heh
<Slant> icky is produced from the root word "ick"
<Slant> icky [phonetic] [Phonetic] [Phonetic] [Phonetic] [Phonetic]
          [Phonetic] [phonetic] adjective INFORMAL
<Slant> unpleasant
<Slant> What an icky colour that green is!
<Slant> Thus, women are unpleasant.
<FlipTopBox> with an attitude like that, you'll never get a woman!
<Slant> pleasant [phonetic] [Phonetic] [Phonetic] [Phonetic] [Phonetic]
          [Phonetic] [Phonetic] [Phonetic] [Phonetic] [Phonetic] [phonetic]
          adjective
<Slant> enjoyable, attractive or friendly; easy to like
<FlipTopBox> but then, that would kill off your PRMntvirgin PSO character
<FlipTopBox> hehe
<Slant> thus, women are not "enjoyable, attractice or friendly; easy to like"
<Slant> Notice the usage of or.
<Slant> it doesn't imply all of the above
<Slant> So when I say "girls are icky"
<Slant> It comes down to a logical structure:
<Slant> {
<Slant> Girl_class girl;
<Slant> girl = new Girl_class;
<Slant> if (!(girl.attractive && girl.enjoyable && girl.friendly &&
          girl.easy_to_like))
<Slant> return Girl_class.ICKY_CONST;
<Slant> else
<Slant> return Girl_class.PRETTY_CONST;
<Slant> }
<FlipTopBox> so then is your point that girlkind (as a demographic) do not
          earn the PRETTY_CONST?
<Slant> Yup.
<FlipTopBox> ahh.
