It's <b>over!</b> I've woken up with my face squished and a missing
Dreamcast. <b>WHO STOLE MY DREAMCAST!?</b> Oh right... I don't own a
Dreamcast. Ugggh.. It was great. We started around 5pm and went until...
(<i>I'm asking someone else right now, I collapsed from exhaustion around
1:30</i>) 3:30am! WOO WOO! The best part? We didn't record a single replay.
:-) Okay, we did, but Chanchai in Oregon has 'em. Talk to him.
</p>

<p>
We're so doing this next week, unless weather is a bitch. Then I'll whine. A
lot.
</p>

<p>
Wow, okay the weather definately acted up in Washington! We had a windstorm
here! The location has been moved to Scott's Hole and we're a bit dusty here
because of <b>blown down trees!</b> Directions here follow. Please part on
the right. ;-)
</p>

<p>
<b>From Highway 18-East</b> (There will be signs)<br>
<li>Turn right on the stop light exit <b>after</b> the main Maple Valley exit.
<li>You will reach 216th (you also hit 216th off <b>Maple Valley Highway</b>) 
<li>There is a stop light/flashing light on 216th in front of a Junior High School. If you are coming from 18-East, continue straight. If you are coming from <b>Maple Valley Highway</b> turn right.
<li>Continue into a dip and then back up. On the hill after the dip, turn left on to 224th.
<li>Continue east on 224th until you reach the left turn private road of 270th. (a gravel road
<li>On top of the 270th's hill, there will be a white <i>22126</i> sign. Turn on to that road.
<li><b>Welcome!</b>
<br>
</p>

<p>
I just got an ICQ from Chanchai. The weather has been acting up here in
Washington, *maybe* the cold front has moved out of Oregon? Not likely.
Either way, "unless there's snow or hell from my parents" Chanchai and Ray
are confirmed.
</p>

<p>
Ian is confirmed and that fills out our DC, twin stick, monitors, TVs, and
every damn other thing with extras. :-) Thus far core AVC and Ian directly
confirmed, and a few other AVCs have been talking about it. Thursday I'll
see if I can't run into the rest of them.
</p>

<p>
Tuesday's gathering was nice. It's official, I'm a gimp on the controller
again. I need to pick, controller or sticks. I don't think both are
possible.
</p>

<p>
Push push push, find out if you can attend. Bring your friends.
<b>Busing</b> is a trick, for those who use buses. If you notify me, we can
try to get some sort of carpool thing going? It isn't a far walk from a
Metro stop, but driving is always more fun. A few people can probably crash,
and then catch a ride into civilization the next morning.
