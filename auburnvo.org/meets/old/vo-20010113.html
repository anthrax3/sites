Well, I just slept in most of the day, but I'm awake now. The ringing in my
ears is gone, but I broke James' sticks so I'm repairing them this week.
While on the subject of sticks, Saturn ones are evil. They require
two people to put back together. Ick.
</p>

<p>
The Gathering was small this time, but was darn fun. It took us until 8pm to
finally get it going officially, mainly because there was much stick repair
for me to do. Lithium Grease is God. Sam never showed up, with or without
equipment. Didn't really talk much about it on the phone this morning. We
also recorded only two replays. Too busy having fun!
</p>

<p>
I think it's safe to say out skill levels are definately increasing... and
quickly too. Mark, James, and I have taken to picking "<cite>Random</cite>"
as our favorite VR. It gives us almost-equal opportunity to expand our
skills. Mark is still learning about the whole game engine, but what he does
know he has locked in. James and I are still going back and forth. Tom is
getting scary in VOOT with VOOM laser prediction abilities. Matt's Apharmd B
is quite deadly, so you can't let your guard down. Summer is working on her
Angelan.
</p>

<p>
I had fun, and once off I didn't get bitched at once, so that didn't suck.
Maybe I will plan another?
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Dave's with his family. I'm leaving. Bye.
</p>

<p>
Half the equipment is locked up at Sam's house. James has come through with
backup equipment. Be sure to give him thanks en mass when you get to the
gathering. I'll be bringing in a monitor because we only have one.
</p>

<p>
If you can't find your way there, meet at Gameworks at 4pm. Tada!
</p>

I love how shit doesn't come together. Gathering #3 and people want to be
bitchy about it. Read my last post about how I feel about people being
bitchy. It's confirmed, I do not want to plan one of these again. Do it your
damn self, guys... oh, and get your own damn phone numbers and e-mail
addresses. Grr. Matt, Mark, and I are busting our asses off getting this
together, and all I get is shit. In happier news, I'm an hour behind
schedule and still screwed up from the concert last night. Ever read a war
book and how the soliders' ears are "<cite>ringing</cite>" after a bomb
blast? Well, ACS combined with a hot <strike>underage</strike> chick did
that to me last night. <b>Anyway</b>, I have to call everyone and make sure
what's-what-is-what's-what. As I understand it, unconfirmed, Eiji is mass
pissed off at us? (Mark) Fun stuff, huh?
</p>

<p>
Matt from Tacoma must come. Bitch.
</p>

<p>
Sam and I are having arrangement problems. We'll see how this affects our
supply of DCs and of twin sticks. Hmm.
</p>

<pre>
<b>Tom:</b> i'm a very high probability participant.  not for sure. but high probability.  and if i do come, i can bring a pizza or two
<b>Scott:</b> So high enough probably to have confirmed? Confirming, of course, doesn't imply you'll attend, but just you believe you will attend.
<b>Scott:</b> Imply belief of the status dubbed 'intendment.' ;-)
<b>Tom:</b> confirm me, baby.</pre>
<i>... and so it came to pass.</i>

<p>
I might be going to the Alien Crime Syndicate/Superdeluxe concert (only $8)
on Friday. If I do, this will definately make the Saturday plans...
<i>interesting</i>... Wish me luck?
</p>

<p>
I just realized something. Virtual-On players are as lazy as me. :-) We all
talk about how it would be so much easier if I plan these things *way* in
advance. This gathering, I lay everything down a good week before hand and
everyone <b>still</b> confirms at the last minute? Of course, it would
probably go better if I didn't update this page at the last minute all the
time. On a side note, Summer is coming. She's even playing!
</p>

<p>
I just spoke to James. He's definately coming, but while we were talking I
pulled up a map and located Matt's Gaping Expanse. It's looks a bit out of
the way? I'll be heading into Seattle tomorrow afternoon/evening checking
everything out. I hope it isn't as weirdly located as it appears. Of course,
worse comes to worse we can always do it again at Mark's Mack Pad... of
course, I'll bring a table and a beanbag this time around. ;-)
</p>

<p>
Got a call from Matt this morning. Matt's Gaping Expanse is confirmed as our
location. Now for people. ;-)
</p>

</p>
Well, I got a call from Mark yesterday and Sam poked me this morning. I've
been asked to get together another Gathering. Mark is offering up his place
but Sam mentioned that Matt mentioned that ... ;-) ... Matt might volunteer
his place? It's reportedly much larger and would be easier to have a full
gathering at. There have been numerous complaints about leg problems from
Mark's. ;-) A pair of chairs and a Costco table are definately nessicary for
the next Gathering. I can supply the table. :-) Anyway, let's see what I
can't rustle up.
