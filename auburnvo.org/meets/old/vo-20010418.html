<h2>I GET TO SLEEP TONIGHT</h2>

You don't understand what I've been going through for the past couple weeks.
Thus, I'm going to explain it to you.

<h3>For two weeks, I couldn't sleep...</h3>

I couldn't sleep. <i>I couldn't sleep.</i> Gah! This, obviously, has been
affecting my school life. Primarily, I haven't started on my English
homework. Heh.

<h3>When you're in Fight Club...</h3>

It's also been affecting my VOOT practice. Mainly, my practice is worth crap
because I don't get any retention. You practice, get a good nights sleep,
and it all stays. This isn't working out for me. It showed tonight. I held
my own; however, I wasn't performed half as well as I usually do. We got a
few replays though. Mark should be posting them on <a
href="http://www.reactor-core.org/vo/">VOA</a> sometime tonight.

<h3>And come tournament?</h3>

I'll be ready. Hopefully you will be too. Check out the <a
href="../index.html">AVC Homepage</a> for the next warm-up gathering. You
know you want to place mad beat-down, or just learn how.

</p>

<p>

<h2>LET'S GET READY TO RUMBLE</h2>

You heard me! Go look on the <a href="../index.html">main site</a>. If you
don't know, now you know. <a href="http://www.sakuracon.org/">Sakura Con</a>
is coming and <b>AVC</b> is running a <a href="sakura01.html">multi-state
VOOT tournament</a> there.

<br>&nbsp;</br>

Most of us haven't done any serious gameplay for a few weeks, and in some
situation a few months. However, we want to play our hardest and make the
best showing we possibly can. <b>Do your best.</b>

<h3>So how do I do that?</h3>

Simple. Right up until the tournament, Matt is hosting Wednesday gatherings
starting at 7:30pm. You attend, you play, you rock.

<h3>But I can't get there...</h3>

If you need any help in attending: transportation issues, timing problems,
lack of confidence, or just plain need to hear my <font
color=purple><i><b>soothing sexy voice</b></i></font>, give me a call and
we'll see what we can arrange. I've been known to make home visits.

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>We'll be waiting.</b>
