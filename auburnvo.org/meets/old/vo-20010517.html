<h2>Wow, I'm posting this late!</h2>

Of course, I'm also really busy. I gotta figure out what I'm going to do
this Summer. Anyone want to give me a job? Bah. Check out the <a
href="../content/interviews/watari.html">interview</a>, why don't you? We
ran into Sato-san on Saturday and he's much more industrious than I.

<h2>Next Gathering Date?</h2>

Auburn Crew keeps saying "make them Thursday!" Summer just said "make it
Thursday." I'm going to ask on the list if it would be appropriate to switch
to Thursday?

<h2>Matt gave me the "official" tournament pics</h2>

So I'll be scanning them in and posting them in the Photo Gallery as soon as
possible. Look for them tomorrow?

<h2>Fin</h2>

<i>What, that's it?</i> You may be asking. Yes. These gathering diaries were
only meant as advertising. I know <b>everyone</b> loves to read my feelings,
but I find them tiresome to write. Maybe I should start a journal, then you
can see me write pretentous all day about my boring ass life!

<h2>The Pat Question</h2>

Nothing but bad news and worse rumours. Brent spoke to Pat and she didn't
sound too keen about coming over and playing some VO with us... for a
variety of reasons. Not the ones you're all thinking though. <i>Be nice.</i>

<br>&nbsp;<br>

In the worse rumours category, Brent said Pat was thinking about taking down
her <a href="http://www.drizzle.com/~tirah/vo.html">hardcore VO site</a>.
She's been getting a bit <a href="http://www.drizzle.com/~tirah/">tired</a>
of the "<b>fan-mail</b>" for years now, and Brent thinks she might be
getting tired of VO as well. All of the above is <b>a darn frick'n
shame</b>. Especially given Pat single-handedly created <b>many</b> VO
scenes, if by her helpful e-mail or her infamous guide to VOOM. <font
color="red"><b>DO NOT</b></font> go out and e-mail her about all this... I
don't think it would help anything.

<br>&nbsp;<br>

Anyway, that's a heads up. Maybe someone should mirror her site?

<h2>Why the time change?</h2>

As was mentioned in the previous gathering diary, Sam and Joe want to come
to some VO Gatherings and I felt maybe changing a day would be interesting
anyway. Thus far there haven't been any complaints against Thursday, so
consider it a change... for this week at least.
