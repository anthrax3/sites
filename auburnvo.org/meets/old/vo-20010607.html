<h2>... and so the pilots met ...</h2>

Ben, Laura, and I managed to show up at Gameworks around four thirty-ish. No
one was around, so we went out and procured some grub. By the time we got
back, Mark G. was on the sticks so a few practice games of VOOT were thus
born. Later, DJ showed and DDR was played all around. Slow movement towards
the Gaping Expanse was seen. Tom was picked up on the way up the hill.

<h2>... and so the pilots arranged ...</h2>

After much running up and down hills, everyone eventually made it to the
Gaping Expanse. A few of the more deranged pilots felt the need to play some
<b>filthy-filthy</b> twitch games before sitting down for some quality VOOT
time. Your intrepid journalist decided to see if he couldn't stand a few
minutes of twitch excitement. A few minutes later, an EMS team was hauling
him out in an ambulance - epileptic seizures racking his body. (<i>I'm
joking, of course.</i>)

<h2>... and so the tournament was formed ...</h2>

Mark G., our organizer for the evening, took stock of the pilots present:

<ul>
    <li>DJ
    <li>Scott
    <li>Mark G.
    <li>Brent
    <li>Ben
    <li>Tom
    <li>Matt
    <li>Eiji
</ul>

Yikes! Significant attrition from the original confirmation list. Worse, DJ
couldn't find the phone numbers for his Japanese friends. However, with
eight people the tournament went on!

<h2>... and so the tournament was fought ...</h2>

Check <a
href="http://www.reactor-core.org/vo/Replays/AVC%20Replays/LBA%20Tournament/">here</a>
for the replays. Just like the still in-progress Sakura Con page, I'll have
a nice and pretty tournament ranking map up... later.

<h2>... and so the tournament was won ...</h2>

In the end, only one could stand as the victor. Your esteemed journalist was
the honored one of the evening. A su-<i>prize</i> of the evening was
presented by Mark G., the <b>Cyber Trooper VIRTUAL-ON "Oratorio Tangram"
Official Sound Data RNA SIDE</b> CD!

<br>&nbsp;<br>

Final Ranking:

<ul>
    <li>Winner: <i>Scott</i>
    <li>Second: <i>Brent</i>
    <li>Third: <i>Ben</i>
    <li>Fourth: <i>Mark G.</i>
</ul>

<h2>Personal Thoughts for the evening</h2>

Even though I was there for a short time, leaving soon after the tournament
ended, I had a lot of fun. Mark G. put on a good tournament which ran much
better than the Sakura Con one. It may seen like it requries nothing; but,
having adminstrated a few, in my time, I respect the work he put into it.

<h3>MP3s</h3>

The su-<i>prize</i> was great - I'm ripping it as I type this. I'll be
updating VOA later tonight with the new MP3s. I'll also be including a
direct rip from the OSV. (same thing, different arrangement)

<h3>Happiness?</h3>

A few people seemed unhappy with how the tournament went. I think the
suprise entry and success of Ben threw everyone off. I was tickled pink, and
in hindsight was being a bit of a jerk-off. Ben definately reinforced the
fact that basic dash angles are worth - <b>oh so much</b>.

<h3>The next tournament?</h3>

I look forward to the next tournament - whoever puts it on. I figure we'll
try to do something large around the middle or end of the summer.

<h2>... and so the pilots bought Scott underwear ...</h2>

Because he needs some, and he's poor. So there.

<h2>... and so the pilots gathered ...</h2>

Meeting at Gameworks to put their best faces on. It was a Summer showdown
amongst the VO+ of Seattle. Only one would walk away with the respect, and
more importantly, the as yet unidentifed prize.

<h2>... and so the pilots prepared ...</h2>

Twin-sticks, Panther DCs, and controllers in the Seattle-metropolitan area
were abuzz for at least a week in preparation for the upcoming tournament.
For the man who puts the "B" in Apharmd B had called a tournament, and who
could resist the siren's call.
