<h2>A Visitor from the South...</h2>

Playing 5.2 down at Gameworks, we ran into Henry from <b>Mississippi</b>!
(<i>yes, I used the rhyme</i>) He came up and engaged in some hot Virtual-On
lov'n. Seriously, though, I think we've infected him. :-)

<br>&nbsp<br>

Maybe it'll spread?

<h2>Yuki is a pimp</h2>

'Nuff said. Good luck on your camping trip!

<h2>... Mark is too, I guess</h2>

... in his own special way. He's expensive too.

<h2>Good News for Chanchai in Oregon!</h2>

It sounds as though he'll be making an appearance in the ranks of the AVC
next week. Chanchai, for those who don't know, is one of the official AVC
members "abroad." Rather, he showed up for the first gathering and has
stayed true to the cause since.

<h2>I've got some screwed up sleeping habits</h2>

In that I've turned almost completely nocturnal. I hope I make it to this
next gathering. No worries, I'll see everyone there.

<h2>I got underwear!</h2>

Due to a recent influx of cash money, I was able to purchase myself some
<i>sweet-sweet</i> pairs of underwear. Jesus, though: $15 for three pairs of
boxers - <b>AT COSTCO</b>. I didn't even wash the suckers before putting
them on. Mmmmm...

<br>&nbsp;<br>

I don't think anyone should feel pleasure this sweet. <b>No way</b> can sex
be this good.
