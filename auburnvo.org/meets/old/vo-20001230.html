<h3>Scott's Post-Gathering Thoughts:</h3>
<i>It's all over but the after-glow.</i> It's Sun Dec 31 03:46:12 PST 2000
now, and I'm updating. :-) We just got back from the Gathering, and now I'm
abusing the DSL at my Grandmother's to download high-speed pr0n. It went
well! Best of all, with all the mountains of VO related equipment and
various breather games, I think everyone sorted out everything that belonged
to them. I <b>almost</b> forgot the speakers' AC converter. I won't say
everyone had fun, but everyone got to play VO and feel good. Nothing is 100%
pleasure.

<h3>So what happened with Ian and Summer</h3>
We're walking back from the Gathering up the hill and the first thing Summer
says, "He talked to me!" Funny stuff, huh? Strange though, the guy hardly
plays VO for being so damn cool. Didn't get a single match in tonight! Sam
noted earlier, "Ian will probably spend most of his time being hilarious."
He was right.

<h3>Why I might not plan and arrange another Gathering</h3>
I'm not saying I won't attend them, but both times I've arranged these I've
been yelled at. I've been verbally abused the entire night. This is a normal
thing I put up with at school; however, I refuse to be the <b>foundation</b>
of any event which exhibits this behavior. I doubt any AVC'ers will be
reading this webpage <i>POST</i> gathering, but plan your own damn gathering
in January. I stood there watching Mark receive (<b>RIGHTFULLY!</b>) thanks
from every person there for hosting the gathering at his apartment. I got
cursed at in trying to pack up and received thanks only from Mark. No Mark,
thank you! I'll have the book back ASAP. I don't think planning this was a
<b>huge</b> job, but if everyone else wants to do this, they're certainly
well on their track.

<h3>Status of the Replays</h3>
Our replays were darn sporatic. I didn't even record most of them, but if
you were to take them as gospel, you'd think I played most of the games. I
didn't. I was to busy being sick. There are quite a few unmarked replays,
for which I apologize. We lost track of most of the sheets of paper with the
replay number information. Next time, I'll add the ability for the upload
script to add descriptions as we proceed throughout the night.

<h3>My take on being <i>overtwentyone</i></h3>
I'm not <i>overtwentyone</i>. Neither were a lot of the people there. I have
no problem with dabbling in the pond of privileges <i>overtwentyone</i> year
olds have, but I would have problem with illegal behavior being linked with
AVC Gatherings. However, I would hope this would never become the norm for
the following reasons:
<ul>
<li>It <b>could</b> cause new-comers to feel uncomfortable.
<li>It <b>could</b> lead to legal problems.
<li>It <b>could</b> limit growth.
</ul>
All of which put me in a position of being staunchly against us doing
whatever happened tonight with any regularity.

<h3>... but did you have fun?!</h3>
Oh god yes. I love VO. I love the company. I love the competition. We'll do
this again. I probably have more stuff to say, but that's all I can think of
right now. Now, to go erase the bad VMU upload and head to sleep.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
So I lied twice? I'm a big fat liar. LIAR LIAR LIAR LIAR LIAR!
<br>
Mark's door code is 030, if you show late.
</p>

<p>
So, I lied? Check list finished except brushing teeth. (I burnt my mouth a
couple days ago) Damn it. I have the cell and everything is packed away in
the car. Let's go to Seattle! Mark is really jazzed about this whole thing
and he's going all out for all of us. I didn't have time to find a Tangram
logo and print it out, but we will have something cool on the door. ;-)
<br>
<b>Who says Auburn VO isn't active?</b>
</p>

<p>
I'm now heading out. Reach me on the cell phone. Last update until tomorrow.
:-)
</p>

<p>
Ian is attending! Hmm, I wonder where Summer will be tonight?
</p>

<p>
Okay, I've written up a script so we can post our VMU files while we're at
the gathering. <strike> <a
href="http://reactor-core.org/vo/Replays/AVC%20Replays/2000-12-30/">Here.</a>
</strike> Be polite and don't upload your own VMS stuff while we are. I'll
be keeping track, so it won't really hurt anything, except it'll be darn
rude. I'll be wrapping the upload stuff into DCDL later so people can have
their own contributed sections on <a
href="http://reactor-core.org/vo/">VOA</a>.
</p>

<p>
<h3>Prizes for best match of the Evening!</h3>
House Rules:<br>
<ul>
    <li>No smoking!
    <li>Shoes off, baby!
    <li>Noise kept at low roar after 9pm.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<i>oh, and one more thing:</i>
<h1>BRING YOUR MUSICAL CDS</h1>
<i>this has been a public service announcement from Scott Robinson, and your
friends, at KGRG.</i>
</p>

<p>
According to Mark, it's going to be packed. The <b>plan</b> is we all meet
up at Gameworks at 3pm. Mark meets up with us at 3:45pm, and we (<i>him and
I</i>) head over to his house to clean it up before-hand and grab the
equipment from my Grandmother's. (<b>if someone drives in, a car would be
nice?</b>) We then head back to Gameworks and everyone comes with us to go
play the night away.
</p>

<p>
<h3>Scott's ToDo List:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strike>Clear out 4x VMU for Replays.</strike>
    <li><strike>Pack up portable speakers.</strike>
    <li><strike>Find ride into Seattle.</strike>
    <li><strike>Get Grandma's apartment keys.</strike>
    <li><strike>Pack monitors into box(s).</strike>
    <li><strike>Burn custom copy of VO for Mark.</strike>
    <li>Brush teeth.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<cite>"should i get beer?"</cite> That is the question...
</p>

<p>
We're going 'til whenever, baby! It's confirmed that 1-2 people can crash
over there too, so I won't be using my <i>crashing</i> privledges to make
way for someone who might need them.
</p>

<p>
Can't control our women. ;-) Apparently Ian made a big impression on the
lady-folk of Gathering #1. My Sister has been spreading around rumours; our
triplet of terror seem to want to "<i>jump [Ian's] bones.</i>" Of course,
the bad news of Ian not being able to go, our ladies don't seem to want to
attend... or rather, will be showing up fashionably late. Jessica seems to
want to flex her newly developed VO skill<b>Z</b> though.
</p>

<p>
<b>I'm not providing food this time.</b> I'm too poor from the last
encounter. Ex: I'll see what I can swing, but don't expect 40 pizzas. ;-)
</p>

<p>
I'm getting into town early to take care of equipment and arrangements. If
you want to contact me for information, use the cell phone number provided
above. I might even be on AIM (<i>H8acker</i>) so you can message me there.
</p>

<p>
For all those driving into town, here's a bit o' information! First off,
there is a <b>damn damn damn</b> cheap parking area less than a block from
the Lowell. It's a little east (<i>up hill</i>) on the corner of 8th and
Seneca. $4 for the day and $4 overnight; max of $8 if you come early for
Gameworks time. As for crashing arrangements, Mark hasn't gotten back to me
but I know <b>I and my family</b> will have emergency arrangements <i>for
ourselves</i> at our nearby Grandmothers' apartment. In <b>no way shape or
form</b> am I implying that anyone else can stay there. <i>wink wink</i>
</p>

<p>
Well, Mark hasn't confirmed a time. I just spent the night wandering around
Seattle trying to the find the Lowell when suddenly I realized I attended a
house-warming party there a few months ago! D'oh! Well, I know all about the
place, and for those having problems (or just want to get a little quality
cabinet gaming time in), I'm going to be at Gameworks at 3pm. You can meet
up with me (and probably others) there.
</p>

<p>
Address is posted. You can figure it out. Hmm, I guess I'm going to have to
arrange special transportation in. I need to bring two monitors. That's the
way life goes!
</p>

<p>
We got a link cable and extra sticks thanks to James! It looks like we'll be
over-hardwared again. This is something I'm not complaining about.
</p>

<p>
I was thinking, parking will definately be an interesting issue. When we had
it in Maple Valley, it was easy because the house had lots of parking.
However, Seattle is a different situation entirely. I'll probably either
head in via bus or catch a ride with Sam and bury the vehicle in the secret
free parking zone near International Station. For those who know Seattle,
underneath the I-90 and I-5 interchange is free parking. You can walk
towards Seattle and run right into the International District Station and
take a bus to Westlake. From there, Gameworks is close and Mark's is too.
Maybe I'll post up better directions or more parking opportunities later?
</p>

<p>
Mark (not the one who works at Gameworks) has opened up his apartment as a
location for our Gathering. It seems things are starting to fall together.
Now, we need to get Ian's link cable. ;-)
</p>

<p>
It's Gathering #2 for the break, and probably the last one <i>if it comes
off.</i> Location arrangement doesn't seem to want to come together. Tom is
offering his as an emergency backup. We need to find someplace in Seattle.
<b>This shall be fun.</b> I wonder if Mark at Gameworks hates me...
</p>
