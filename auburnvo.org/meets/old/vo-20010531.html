<h2>Summer is on a plane to Arizona</h2>

So she out of gatherings for the next month.

<h2>Crazy Taxi 2</h2>

Could this compete with VOOT as my favorite game ever? Not a chance.
However, I've almost completed the Crazy Pyramid. Hee hee. I'm on S-S right
now.

<h2>We implemented <i>rensyo-hosei</i></h2>

Or, as Mark says, "The Virtuafighter Rule." In short, you pickup five wins,
you're off the system. Time to let someone else grab a winning streak.

<h2>Tournament Next Time!</h2>

Mark is setting up a tournament for the next gathering. I guess it'll be a
tournament report. Cool, huh?

</p>

<h2>I'm going to cry...</h2>

The realization just set in. I'll never see the Auburn VOOM machine again. I
loved that machine. I earned 115 straight wins on that machine. I practiced
basic electronics on that machine. I discovered, learned, practiced, formed
a scene, and spent four <b>happy</b> years playing VO on that machine.
:<b>sniff</b>: I'm going to miss it all. However, it was going to happen
someday - I always dreaded this day.

<br>&nbsp;<br>

Oh yeah, and I'll miss everyone there too. You're all credited in my VOOT
Faq. ;-)

<br>&nbsp;<br>

In short, I'll probably sniffle once or twice at the next gathering. No
eulogies.

<h2>Big Gathering?</h2>

If everything comes though it sounds like more than a few (<i>HA HA!</i>)
will be showing up to this week's gathering. Cool, ne? 

<h2>I'm stupid. You're stupid. We're all with stupid.</h2>

Sheesh. No one notices the Thursday of this gathering <b>is not</b> June
1st, as was previously advertised; rather, <b>May 31st!</b> Dates, links,
and other related material have been updated appropriately.

<h2>3 shiki</h2>

I expect we'll be seeing quite a bit of this come the next gathering. I
wonder how we'll cope with it. Kirk in Cali doesn't like it much, and I
<i>think</i> their scene is still better than us. Hopefully, we'll find a
counter.

<h2>So... my life just went through a major change</h2>

I just was politely asked to leave my school. I am now on <a
href="http://www.mrsc.org:8080/cgi-bin/om_isapi.dll?clientID=110529&hitsperheading=on&infobase=wac.nfo&jump=132J-125-160&softpage=Document42#JUMPDEST_132J-125-160">non-academic
disciplinary suspension</a>. Apparently, I said I would &quot;bring a
<b>gun</b> to school and go Columbine.&quot; I'm so glad someone told me
what I said. It's being appealed, of course, but we'll see what happens.
It's not like our country has a very good culture about this.
