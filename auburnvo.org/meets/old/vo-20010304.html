I'll remember this in the future. 20 confirms, 20 drops. Screw setting up
gatherings. I'll post locations and I'll post announcements to seattle-vo,
but I'm not working on them anymore. They will never be on Sunday again,
too.
</p>

<p>
Dropping like flies. From now on, no more Sunday gatherings. The people who
this was specially setup for even dropped. Bah.
</p>

<p>
Mark H. dropped. School issues are always more important than VO. Good luck!
</p>

<p>
I sent off an e-mail since this stupid page doesn't want to update. Woo. At
least it's still available on the internal server at
<a href="http://robhome.dyndns.org/~scott/dsn.itgo.com/vo.html">RobHOME</a>.
</p>

<p>
Due to certain problems at Mark's house, Saturday night, we're moving to
Matt's. We're okay until midnight! (though, I'm sure some of us have
school.) Tom is confirmed for a bit after 5pm.
</p>

<p>
Okay, a few more confirmations off. People keep bitching about a lack of
address. It's on Bellevue and Olive. ;-) Damn it Mark, e-mail me with final
information. This one looks like it will be pretty small; but c'est la vie.
</p>

<p>
Okay, I filled in the "<i>if we can rope them into it</i>" with all the
special people who haven't attended a VO gathering lately... official or
unofficial. Not to sound pushy, but we'll find a way.
</p>

<p>
Gasp! The beloved VOOTer and SydVOC poster, Mr. Thomas Delany Music, will be
celebrating his birthday on the same date of this particular gathering. If
he shows (<i>keep in mind, he's turning 21</i>), we'll figure out something
special to do for him. And by "<b>we</b>" I mean "<b>me</b>." <i>You'll
just be included.</i> ;-)
</p>

<p>
In reality, this is a straight rename from the Feburary Sunday gathering
which wasn't very advertised because.. well.. I'm lazy. This one is on a
Sunday because it's convenient for people and we want to see how well they
come off. I promise to really spam everyone this time.
</p>

<p>
Hmm, don't think this is going to come off. No one feels like confirming.
</p>

<p>
Okay, here is the honest truth. There were supposed to be, at least, two
updates to this page during the little break. What happened?
<a href="http://www.phantasystar.net/">Phantasy Star Online</a>. Damn you
Sega! I wanted to pass this quarter! DAMN YOU, YOU! Okay, I promise, even
though this is coming a bit late, there will be a gathering this Sunday.
What will happen and who will come? We'll see...
</p>

<p>
Official update. I'm going to spam out the information. Love it?
