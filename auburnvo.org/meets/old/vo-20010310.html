Yay, that was <b>much</b> more fun that last week. Less stress. There were a
few comments of me being apathetic, but I don't care.
</p>

<p>
We had some sweet 5.2 action down at GW for a few hours before heading up
the the apartments. I spoke to Mark and we might set something big during
Spring Break. I know Chanchai and crew are coming up on a weekend during a
break, so it should be interesting. Maybe a<i>(nother)</i> Gameworks-con?
;-)
</p>

<p>
We're all a bit out of practice, but the next few weeks should remedy this.
I've found myself stubbing the dash triggers lately. I'm too fast again and
need to retune my reflexs. I think Mark got a few replays and and we'll see
if he doesn't upload them to <a
href="http://www.reactor-core.org/vo">Virtual-On Archive</a>. Gosh, I
<b>really</b> hope he doesn't upload my crappy Dordray play. :<i>shiver</i>:
</p>

<p>
James might be moving in with Matt next quarter, and that'll be cool. I
swear, Summer attends to many of these no to just admit to liking
Virtual-On. I need to buy a second pair of sticks (<i>right after getting
rid of my $100 "<b>debt</b>" to the bank.</i>) and get some hot deathmatch
action going on here at the hizouse.
</p>

<p>
On a side note, doesn't everything sound cooler when you add nonsensical
syllables to it? "<i>Hizouse, snip-snap-diddly-do-dap, boom-badda-bambam,
and Temjin-a-roni.</i>" <b>Yeeeeah....</b> that's all I can think of right
now. I'm going to go back to obsessing about <b>Nadesico.</b>
<i><b>GUKIGUNDAR FIST!</b></i>
</p>

<p>
No address provided as yet. Just call me on the cell if you need directions.
</p>

<p>
We'll be meeting at Gameworks at 7:30pm around the VOOT machine. I hope to
dig up Mark's address though, later tonight.
</p>

<p>
Well, that wasn't nice. I'm throughly liquored up on Sprite now, so I'm much
happier. Finished my Psych test too! It's the section I hate,
bio-physiology. I think I might have even passed this one with a B. The rest
are As, so I'm happy. 3.0 this quarter, mmm hmm.
</p>

<p>
Welcome to the day of the Gathering, and the posting. Attend if you want.
I'm a bit pissed from the last "event."
