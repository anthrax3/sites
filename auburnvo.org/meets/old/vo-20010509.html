<h2>How are we doing post-tournament</h2>

I think my gameplay was much better at the tournament than tonight. I think
my style may have been affected by all the recent stressors school has
decided to put on to me. Oh well.

<br>&nbsp;<br>

I swear though, I watch everyone else play and I wonder how I ever get a win
in. Why does everyone look so much more polished and refined than me?

<h2>The Pat Question?</h2>

Brent showed us a replay with Pat and himself, which got us to talking about
her and the possibility of Pat coming to one of our Wednesday gatherings. Of
course, the trick comes in with the fact that Pat and I do not always get
along the best. (she <b>hates</b> me) I, for one, hope she decides to at
least make one appearance. Pat holds the distinction of having
facilitated/created/encouraged/etc many-many people, worldwide, VO-infected
lifestyles. We'll see what happens.

<h2>New Time!</h2>

Normally we all meet up at Gameworks around 7:30pm and get the whole shabam
started at 8pm. However, Matt has a new job which requires him to wake up at
6am the following morning. We can't be causing disasters as we do now. Next
week, look forward to the newly revised time of meeting around 5:30pm and
actually started at 6pm. Of course, if you can't make it at the begining,
it <b>does not</b> exclude you from coming late. :-)

<h2>Replays</h2>

We actually recorded some (<b>a</b> on the net) replays tonight. Of course,
no one is ever satisfied with their performance in them. (<i>someone must
always be the loser</i>) <a
href="http://reactor-core.org/vo/Replays/AVC%20Replays/2001-05-09/">Check
them out here.</a> If you have a few other replays recorded that night, feel
free to pass them along to me.

<h2>You want your stuff back?</h2>

I would suggest coming to this gathering. It'll be much easier. You also get
high quality VOOT action. What could be better?
