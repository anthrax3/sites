<h2>The last time you'll see this site design</h2>

... and it's gone. We've switched over to Sam's wonderful layout. It's busy,
yes, but it also instantly increased click-though. We'll see where it takes
us.

<h2>Psycho Cat</h2>

The cable eating cat must go. Tom has taken the first step with his SIDS
modelled attack - can the rest of us continue with his initiative?

<h2>Crappy Gameplay</h2>

You heard it here first! I suck!

<h2>DJ, as always, damn smooth</h2>

DJ definately made the gathering with his forethought in recording Dark
Nguyen's <a href="http://www.sydvoc.com/forum/?read=8696">VOOT music
videos</a> to VHS and showing them at the gathering.

<br>&nbsp;<br>

The tape's home is current Matt's casa.

<h2>No Ben, no Mr. T. - instead, a warm helping of Brent</h2>

Brent made a special guest appearance. Don't you wish you were as, dare I
say, <b>dope</b>, as him? Come on down and maybe it'll rub off on you.

<h2>Scary women!</h2>

Finishing off the wrap-up, the women-folk at the Gaping Expanse have gone
crazy... or drunk! (or both?) Watch out, they might talk about your biceps
or make you feel inadequate.

<hr>

<p>

<h2>Mr. T is coming to throw the smack down</h2>

... I swear, really! Though it's probably not the Mr. T you think - it's
Mike T - the master Dorkas player from South AVC. He's had a bit o' Dordray
training, so we'll see whats-what.

<h2>Ben BEN Ben</h2>

Another guest appearance? He might he showing up later in the night, if we
go late enough. Time for me to bother Matt.

<h2>The Work Factor</h2>

Too many people with jobs. Mark G. will be showing up a bit late. I think
the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/seattle-vo/surveys?id=712228">new
schedule poll</a> is probably a good thing. Go forth and fill out your
entries - letting your voice be heard.

<h2>New Guests!</h2>

Well, Scott F. will be making a guest appearance at the gathering. Frank
Navaash might also be stopping by with him, but that remains to be seen.

<h2>Summer Quarter starts - New Gathering Time?</h2>

And a few pilots drop from the ranks. DJ and Mark H. will be taking a break
from Thursday night VOOT gatherings due to both taking the excellent
Conversation Japanese class at SCC North.

<br>&nbsp;<br>

These are the first two drops, but I've been talking to quite a few people
and while Thursday nights were lovely during the school year - now people
are working full time during the summer in order to build cash supplies.
We'll see where this leads, but I think it is about time we open up a new
discussion about gathering times.
