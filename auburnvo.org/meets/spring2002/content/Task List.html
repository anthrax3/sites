    <h2>Equipment List (Scott)</h2>

        <i>Todo.</i>
      </p>

    <h2>Spring Tournament 2002 [website update] (<i>VOLUNTEER!</i>)</h2>

      <p>

        Write up page layout with tournament information and probable player
        list. See the above and duplicate for tournament.

    <h2>Tournament Layout (<i>VOLUNTEER!</i>)</h2>

    <p>

      You won't be running the tournament. (unless, of course, you want to)
      However, I'm in need of good ideas to run a 30+ (odd number) player
      tournament that is <b>fair</b>. Put together a full proof plan, make
      it in writing, and make it administratable by someone besides you.

      This your opportunity to break out streak of bitching! Money where
      mouths are!
