//  1.1. ... Virtual-On  //
//-----------------------//

Sega's Cybertroopers Virtual On: Oratorio Tangram is the sequel to
Cybertroopers Virtual-On: Operation Moongate. Virtual-On is a 3D PvP "mech"
fighting game spanning over four gaming systems. It is arguably one of the
deeper fighting games and is alone in its genre due to its high quality.

More information on Virtual-On is available in the Further Reading (A.1)
section.

All damages in this guide (unless otherwise specified) are performed against
a 0% V.Armour Dordray on Space Dock after the initial damage boost. Dordray
was selected because it has the highest knockdown/stun resistance.

If there are any corrections, please feel free to send them in!

//-----------------------------------//
//  1.4. ... the Temjin - MBV-707-G  //
//-----------------------------------//

Temjin is the medium class VR. A carry-over VR from VOOM, its basic style
style was retained for purposes of transitioning players. It is heavily
dependent upon its Long Launcher for damage and upon its Power Bomb for
cover. Its Sword is mostly useful in CC. Temjin's strengths are best
utilized in both medium and CC range.

At higher levels of competition, Temjin becomes an angle machine!
Outguessing your opponent, using mind games to throw them off, and
occasionally throwing in Temjin's more powerful (but uncancellable) attacks
makes him very dangerous and a highly effective VR.

//  3.1. Introduction  //
//---------------------//

In CC, Temjin's basic chains are extremely easy to master; however, they
have very little variation. Its basic CC range is extremely long and well
worth exploiting. The LW and QS-CC are definitely staples.

In short, Temjin is basically a middle-tier learners VR. You can use it to
pick up the basics of Virtual-On medium and long range combat.

//-----------------//
//  3.2. Basic CC  //
//-----------------//

[3.2.1 Basic Variations]

Temjin's basic CC variations are well designed in their effectiveness
changes depending on the skill level of the player and their opponent.

The basic LW Quick Slice is Temjin's most useful basic CC attack. While it
cannot be used as an advanced technique opening against any VR except
Dordray, its relative quickness and high damage makes it great for quick CC
hit and runs.

The Poke is Temjin's quickest basic CC attack. It often can interrupt all
but the very fastest of forseen CC attacks - as such it makes for a great
basic counter. It also is the usual opening into more advanced CC tactics.
However, it's attack angles are the tightest of any of Temjin's basic CC
variations and thus its use is often limited.

The Sword is often used by Temjin newbies or opponents who have recently
made their transition from VOOM. At higher levels of gameplay, the CW is
primary used as a shinku(u) extension counter. Otherwise, it's usage is
often ignored in favour of a quicker and higher damaging RTCC variation.

   LW (396)   +Cr (286) 59.9m   - Left-Right Quick Slice (Drop Kick Trip)
   RW (363)   +Cr (242) 69.9m   - Poke (Low Poke)
   CW (429)   +Cr (374) 99.9m   - Left-Right Slice (Unblockable Left-Right
                                    Slice)

[3.2.2 Turbo Variations]

Temjin's RTCC variations are fairly average in their versatility. Their
primary use is for extra damage when your opponent has been locked in an
uncancellable attack or is stunned long enough for a single clean attack to
be used.

Temin's Power Punch is the quickest of all the variations, with the Drop
flip Slice and Behind the back Slice coming in second and third,
respectively.

One interesting trick is while the RTCC variations are not post-hit QS or
dash cancellable, they are post-hit guard cancellable. Thus, if your
opponent is in stun from a [Cr]RTCW (rare) it is possible to perform a
swallow's tail using the following chain: RT[w] -(G)> QS -> (2.5[w] or
5.2[w])

RT+
   LW (451)     - Power Punch
   RW (478)     - Drop flip Right-Left Slice
   CW (500)     - Behind the back Left-Right Slice

[3.2.3 Quick Step CC]

          Direction
LT+   /  Left | Right \
      +---------------|
   LW |   1   |   1   |
   RW |   1   |   1   |
RT+   +------275------+
   LW |   1   |   1   |
   RW |   1   |   1   |
      \---------------/

1 - Temjin circles around the opposing VR, slicing with its Beam Sword.

[3.2.4 Guard Reversal CC]

Temjin's guard reversals are fairly standard in their usage but great in
their ability. The GrLW, with its great reach and rotation, is best used for
interrupting QS-CC or attacking an enemy who is off-angle. The GrRW is quick
and long, making it an effective interruption attack.

   LW (242)     - Excellent homing and reach. Use to in
   RW (209)     - Great for interrupting enemies out of CC!

[3.2.5 Jumping CC]

Temjin jumps and swings its Beam Sword above its head and smashes it down
upon the opposing VR.

 J+
   LW (440)     - More homing, more damage!
   RW (407)
   CW (407)

[3.2.6 Ground-Hit CC]

Temjin's ground-hit is of a normal speed; however, unless you're on bearing
with the opposing VR, it has a tendency to miss completely.

   RW (14.3%)   - Pokes its Beam Sword downwards into the fallen
                    opposing VR.

[3.2.7 Dashing CC]

Temjin's dashing CC is odd in that its LW and RW dashing CCs are not
symmetrical; instead, they represent different ends of the animation
spectrum. The LW dashing CC is much more pronounced and sweeps in a wide
arc. The RW dashing CC is very quick and sweeps in a tight angle.

   LW (330)     - Sweeps its Beam Sword in an arc left of its body.
   RW (330)     - Sweeps its Beam Sword in an arc right of its body.
   CW (456)     - Swings its Beam Sword above its head and down into the
                    opposing VR. (Ground-Hit Capable)

//-------------------------//
//  3.3. Chain and Combos  //
//-------------------------//

Temjin's chains are extremely simple two-hits which cause reasonable damage.
Use one of Temjin's Cr cancels instead of the second hit in a two-hit chain;
the Cr gives more damage and is unblockable.

[3.3.1 Basic Chains]

   LW  (396)    +Cr (286)  DOR  - Left-Right Quick Slice (Drop Kick Trip)
    LW (638)    +Cr (682)       - Right-Left Quick Slice ("")
    RW (583)    +Cr (638)       - Poke (Low Poke)
    CW    NA    +Cr (770)       - (Unblockable Left-Right Slice)

   RW  (363)    +Cr (242)  TEM  - Poke (Low Poke)
    LW (605)    +Cr (649)       - Left-Right Quick Slice (Drop Kick Trip)
    RW (550)    +Cr (605)       - Elbow Smash (Low Poke)
    CW    NA    +Cr (737)       - (Unblockable Left-Right Slice)

[3.3.2 Swallow's Tail]

Temjin's swallow's tails, similar to Temjin's other CC types, are straight
forward and normal. The RW dashing CC requires more stringent timing than
the LW due to their varying arcs.

   LW  (396)  DOR   - Left-Right Quick Slice
    LW (726)        - Sweeps its Beam Sword in an arc left of its body.
    RW (726)        - Sweeps its Beam Sword in an arc right of its body.
    CW (852)        - Swings its Beam Sword above its head and down into the
                        opposing VR.

   RW  (363)  TEM   - Poke
    LW (693)        - Sweeps its Beam Sword in an arc left of its body.
    RW (693)        - Sweeps its Beam Sword in an arc right of its body.
    CW (819)        - Swings its Beam Sword above its head and down into the
                        opposing VR.

[3.3.3 Shinku(u) Cancel]

Temjin has, arguably, has the "fairest" shinkuus in the game.

The CW shinku(u) is restricted to being an attack extension because of its
immediate knockdown effect. Due to the CW speed, it is much more effective
as a shinku(u) counter.

Temjin's RW shinku(u) also works as an attack extension (+ counter) and has
the added feature of being a ground-hit shinku(u). However, both these usages
are not are effective as the other two weapons offer and so the RW shinku(u)
is often ignored.

Finally, the LW shinkuu fullest effect applies only to Dordray. Because,
when Dordray has accumulated no stun, it isn't knocked down by a full LW
hit, a good Temjin player can work in a normal shinku(u) for 792 points of
damage against a Dordray opponent!

   LW (792)     Easy    Omni    - Cancel when Beam Sword is between 10-11:00
                                    (pre-hit) or 1-2:00 (post-hit) position.
   RW (726)     VHard   Omni    - Cancel when Beam Sword is at furthest
                                    extent.

//-----------------------//
//  3.4. LT Projectiles  //
//-----------------------//

Temjin's LTCW variations are the most damaging LT variation, long-range.
Depending on your angle in CC, however, it would be wiser to use the LTLW or
LTRW for their increased stun properties.

   LW (BBD)     +Cr (ANG)  DAM  - Bouncing Bomb (Launch Bomb)
   RW (DOR)     +Cr (GRY)  NDAM - Tapping Beam (Crouching Tapping Beam)
   CW (BBD)     +Cr (BBD)  DAM  - Fin Beam Sword (Crouching Fin Beam Sword)

definitive knockdown values are released, these will make more sense. For
the moment, understand that Temjin is knocked down easier than Bal-Bados but
is more stable than Fei-Yen.
