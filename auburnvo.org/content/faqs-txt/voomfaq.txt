//------------------//
//  1.1. Storyline  //
//------------------//

(this storyline is a rough translation and has been cleaned up. Same
content, better grammar and tense.)

Earth has entered the Virtual Century (V.C.). The world is now controlled by
a few large syndicates that operate the media industry. A new dark age has
dawned.

Humanity has switched its focus from saving the planet to space colonization.
Compared to the Earth, the space colonies are expanding and developing at a
much greater rate and the syndicates on the Earth are wary of the colonies
newfound power.

In V.C.0084, one of the syndicates on Earth, Dynatech and Nova (DN), found,
on the moon, the ruins of a civilization housing technology far more
advanced than on the Earth or any of the space colonies. DN has hidden this
technology and is using it to produce weapons that are much more advanced
than its competitors'. These human-like robots are code-named Virtuaroids
(VRs).

It turns out, VRs are difficult to control, and only people who are "Virtual
On Positive" (VO+) are capable of controlling a VR well. In a discreet
attempt to search for these people, DN created a video game called "Virtual
On: Cybertroopers" and placed it in the local video arcades to test for VO+
players. Unknown to the players, there is a remote control system in each
console that can link-up the simulators to actual VRs situated on the Moon,
where DN's VR factory is located.

However, the central computer in the VR factory has suddenly become
self-aware, and has taken control of the DN enterprise on the Moon. The
ultimate weapon, the Sun Cannon, has been activated by the central computer.

Sensing disaster, DN has little choice but to destroy the renegade factory
with their VRs. Operation Moongate has been put into action, the satellite
link-ups are activated, and VO+ players are (unknowingly) now used in a
real-life wargame. Can you battle your way through the renegade Virtuaroids
and destroy the Sun Cannon before it destroys the Earth?


//--------------------//
//  1.2. The Cabinet  //
//--------------------//

The Virtual On game cabinet is not so much a cabinet as it is a decked out
video game center. Similar to Sega's other Model 2, sit-down consoles (e.g.
Daytona II), the Virtual On cabinet has comfortable and fully adjustable
molded plastic seats. The speakers are located to the left and right of a
HUGE television from which you can see your VR beat the living doo-doo out
of your opponent's VR.

Make friends with this chair, it will soon be the place you spend all your
time.


//----------------------//
//  1.3. The Interface  //
//----------------------//

More important than anything else on the entire "cabinet" are the controls.
These are your interface to the world of Virtual On. The game often tricks
people with its simplisitic control interface. Let's diagram, shall we:

/-----------------------------------------------------\
|                                                     |
|         _+\                             _+\         |
|         | |+                            | |+        |
|         | |            Start            | |         |
|         | |              O              | |         |
|        -----                           -----        |
|     Left Stick                      Right Stick     |
|                                                     |
\-----------------------------------------------------/

Within this document we'll (ab)use a standard set of joystick movement codes
to instruct you on how to not flail yourself silly in the game.


F|B , CW + [T]
^ ^ ^ ^     ^
| | | |     \---- Press your right dash button  [dash selection]
| | | \---- Press both weapon triggers          [weapon selection]
| | \---- Delay for action                      [delay type]
| \---- Pull your RIGHT joystick BACKWARD       [joystick movement]
\---- Push your LEFT joystick FORWARD           [joystick movement]


[1.3.1 delay type]

Delays are needed in between certain joystick inputs:

[command 1] , [command 2] - Don't input "action 2" until "command 1" occurs.
                            You can delay "command 2" until "command 1" finishs
                            executing.
[command 1] + [command 2] - Perform "command 1" and "command 2"
                            simultaneously.
[command 1] ~ [command 2] - Perform "command 2" immediately after performing
                            "command 1".


[1.3.2 joystick movement]

In this FAQ, joystick movement codes are a set of at least two letters. The
codes tell you where to place your two joysticks.

F - PUSH joystick FORWARD
B - PULL joystick BACKWARD
L - MOVE joystick LEFT
R - MOVE joystick RIGHT
. - PLACE the joystick in a NEUTRAL position (centered)

Examples:

    F|B     - PUSH your LEFT joystick FORWARD and PULL your RIGHT joystick
                BACKWARD.

    R|L     - Bringing your two joysticks in towards one another.

    FR|FR   - PUSH both your joysticks FORWARD and RIGHT (diagonally).


[1.3.3 weapon selection]

In Virtual On, each VR has three primary weapon systems. Activation of each
weapon system is keyed to pressing the front red triggers on the
joysticks...

LW - Left Weapon activation.    Press the LEFT trigger.
RW - Right Weapon activation.   Press the RIGHT trigger.
CW - Center Weapon activation.  Press BOTH triggers simultaneously.

Each weapon also has variations available that are important in certain
situations:

(replace [w] with a weapon code)

C[w] = R|L+[w]  - Crouching Weapon activation
J[w] = L|R,[w]  - Jumping Weapon activation


[1.3.4 dash activation]

Two redundant dash triggers are on top of the joysticks.

(replace [m] with a joystick movement)

[m]+T - TAP a SINGLE DASH trigger

Examples:

    R|R+T   - MOVE both joysticks RIGHT then TAP the DASH trigger.
                Results in your VR RUSHing RIGHT.

    FR|FR+T - MOVE both joysticks FORWARD and RIGHT then TAP the DASH
                trigger. Results in your VR RUSHing FORWARD DIAGONALLY
                RIGHT.


//-----------------//
//  1.4. The Game  //
//-----------------//

Virtual On, the game, can be cleanly divided into five sections:


[1.4.1 Ground Mode]

You sit down, you put your credits in, and you're transported to a mystical
world of Virtual On... though more specifically you're fighting the NULL AI
of Temjin on the level known as the Flooded City.

In Ground Mode you fight five computer (local console) controlled AIs in
five radically different environments to learn how to play Virtual On. Its
the training mode. So have fun!

The VRs and their levels follow:

1. Temjin at the Flooded City (8th Planet: Flesh Refoe)
    Basically cannon fodder. However, he's a prime example of the Virtual On
    learning chip. If your local Virtual On scene has been playing a lot of
    Temjin well, then he won't be defeated so easily. Don't worry though,
    power-cycle the machine and you're ok.

2. Viper II at the Airport (Rentarea #??)
    Teaches you anti-air and how to cope with an arena with lots of
    buildings.

3. Dorkas at the Waterfront (Terminal City #359)
    Generally considered the first "real" AI in the game. Most beginners
    begin having their bad luck here. Teaches you anti-turtling skills and
    how to handle explosive weapons. (Phalanx)

4. Belgdor at the Green Hills (8th Planet: Flesh Refoe)
    The first actively escaping VR on the first open arena! However, there
    is a small bug in the AI that allows for quick wins. See further down or
    see if you can figure it out yourself.

5. Bal-Bas-Bow at the Ruins (")
    Once a player can reliably defeat the first four VRs, it's Bal-Bas-Bow
    that usually screws up their times. It's playing style is unlike any
    encountered thus far and throws off most intermediate players. It's sad,
    but most players, instead of learning how to cope with "true" aerial
    warefare, just find a strategy that works against the AI and continue on
    to...

[1.4.2 Jaguarandi]
    The Mid-Boss of Virtual On. Activated by most beginning players, he
    comes online if a player spends more than an average of 30 seconds per
    previous VR.

    Big, deadly, and out of control. Jaguarandi is the Virtual remains of
    the first VR pilot, a young boy. Jaguarandi is his mental perception of
    himself made real through a software glitch. The designers of Virtual On
    don't know how Jaguarandi itself came to exist, but they don't plan on
    removing "him."

[1.4.3 Space Mode]
    After defeating all the training VRs and maybe Jaguarandi, Mind Shift
Battle System kicks in and you're transported to a REAL VR in a REAL war
zone. A whole new set of "real" AI VRs are ready for you to bash in.

1. Apharmd at the Space Dock (8th Planet: Flesh Refoe)
    A formidable VR with a formidable AI. It'll give most players their
    first "real" experience in close combat.

2. Fei-Yen at the Moon Base (the Moon?)
    A _cheap_ _cheap_ CHEAP AI. If you're going for time, it's the most
    likely to ruin it.

3. Raiden at Death Trap aka Invertebrate Shaft (Restricted Area MG/a0)
    In reality, Raiden is a bit of a let down. You fight through all these
    cool AIs and then you get Raiden. Unless you've smoked yourself retarded,
    you'll cream him easy.

[1.4.4 Z-Gradt]
    FINAL BOSS. Secret Secret. ;)


=============================================================
Part II: The Absolute Basics (and some you might have missed)
=============================================================


//-------------------------------------------------------//
//  2.1 Toddler Years (or how to walk without flailing)  //
//-------------------------------------------------------//

For someone first approaching Virtual On, the most difficult challenge of
the game is controlling their VR without making it look like it's having an
epileptic seizure. This section should help you out in _looking_ like you
know where you're going.


[2.1.1 Walking and Rotating]

If you've never driven a tank, here is your chance. The VR controls exactly
like one:

F|F - WALK FORWARD
B|B - WALK BACKWARD
R|R - WALK RIGHT
L|L - WALK LEFT

Rotation is key in Virtual On. As a full 3D game, one of the key facet of
the game is to keep your opponent on your screen and within your firing
radius.

F|B - ROTATE your VR RIGHT
B|F - ROTATE your VR LEFT

These are useless, but included anyway for your pleasure.

.|R - SHUFFLE RIGHT
L|. - SHUFFLE LEFT

Keep in mind it is possible to chord the rotate and walking movements so
that you walk and rotate. The advantage of this is keeping an opponent on
screen but still avoiding their fire.


[2.1.2 Dashing]

"Make it fast!" So be it. Dashing is another key facet of Virtual On. It
allows you to get from Point A to Point B _FAST_. Really fast.

(replace [m] with a joystick movement)

[m]+T - DASH in the DIRECTION you move the joysticks in.

However, if for some reason you've decided you've dashed in the wrong
direction:

(replace [m-] with a joystick movement OPPOSITE of [m])

[m]+T , [m-]+T - DASH CANCEL
 ^       ^
 |       \---- This is the CANCEL movement.
 \---- This starts your DASH.

Examples:

    R|R+T , L|L+T       - Start and CANCEL a RIGHT DASH.

    FR|FR+T , BL|BL+T   - Start and CANCEL a FORWARD DIAGONAL RIGHT DASH.


[2.1.3 Jumping]

So far, all of Virtual On could be played on a 2D plane. We (and Sega)
wouldn't do that to you! (Namco would...) Thus, it is possible rocket into
the air and stare down at the wonderful arena (and enemy VR) below you.

L|R - JUMP

However, if for some reason you've decided being in the air isn't for you,
you can always cancel the jump: (though only BEFORE you reach the apex, the
top, of your jump)

L|R , R|L - JUMP then CANCEL
 ^  ^  ^
 |  |  \---- This is your JUMP CANCEL.
 |  \---- This delay only applies until the APEX of your JUMP.
 \---- This is your JUMP action.

If getting the Y-axis advantage on your opponent wasn't cool enough, JUMPing
causes your VR to automatically orient itself towards your opponent's VR.
Thus the fast application of a JUMP CANCEL flips yourself towards your
opponent without having to wait to rotate.
