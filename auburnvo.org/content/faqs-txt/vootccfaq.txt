//  1.1. ... Virtual-On  //
//-----------------------//

Sega's Cybertroopers Virtual On: Oratorio Tangram is the sequel to
Cybertroopers Virtual-On: Operation Moongate. Virtual-On is a 3D PvP "mech"
fighting game spanning over four gaming systems. It is arguably one of the
deeper fighting games and is alone in its genre due to its high quality.

More information on Virtual-On is available in the Further Reading (A.1)
section.

//-------------------------//
//  1.3. ... close combat  //
//-------------------------//

The original Virtual-On (VO), Operation Moongate, was a cut down version of
what Juro Watari originally wanted; he was limited by the hardware. One of
the symptoms of the trimming process was that mid to long-range combat had
serious damage potential. The game was unbalanced in Watari's mind. In
Oratorio Tangram, Watari-san had the opportunity to fix this problem. Thus,
the concept of V.Armour was formed. It encouraged the players of a VO game
to come closer and play mid-range and, inevitably, close-range.

Close combat (CC) is the fastest, most confusing, and most complex aspect of
the game. The damage potential in CC is the greatest in the entire game;
however, it is that potential which scares most people away from the depths
of CC.

[1.3.1 Basic Weapon Strategy]

When it comes down to the technical pieces of CC, it's all about pressing
the correct button at the correct time. With that in mind, the basic button
chording sequences allowed in CC are slightly different than long-range:

   [w]                  A normal attack. (Guard-able)
   Cr[w]                A crouching attack. (UnBLOCKable, Knockdown and
                         Ground-Hit)
   RT[w]                A turbo attack. (UnGUARDable, Knockdown and
                         Ground-Hit)
   Gr[w]                A Guard-Reversal attack. (Guard-able)

The difference between BLOCKing and GUARDing (the same action) is that a
successful guard receives minimal damage (0.1%-5%); however: a) with a
broken block, you receive the full damage of the attack and are knocked
down. b) with a broken guard, you receive your guard damage and are knocked
down.

[1.3.2 Chains]

Instead of Street Fighter-esqe unblockable-once-started combinations, the
creators of Virtual-On opted for a chain system. A Virtual-On chain is a
series of CC attacks which have a minimal delay between them. After the
first hit in a CC chain, the animations of the continued CC attacks are
usually quicker and different than the normal variations.

Virtual-On's CC chains are still blockable between the attacks, and are slow
enough for most VRs' Guard-Reversals, so be cautious. Also, not all VRs will
remain standing for the entirity of a CC chain. CC chains, treated by the
game like a normal standing attack, are also completely cancellable.

[1.3.3 The Quick-Step]

Positioning was quite limited in VOOM. The mirage, yatsuhashi, and
positional circle-slices were your only ways of positioning yourself for the
kill. In VOOT, your situation has been significantly improved.

The Quick-Step (QS) is a set distance rotation movement only available in CC
range. This means that the closer you are to your opponent, the higher your
rotation is around them. At the closest range, a QS rotates you 180 degrees
(3.14 radians) behind your opponent. However, your rotation can vary
anywhere from almost 15 degrees (0.25 radians) to 180 degrees.

The QS movement is omni-directional. You can QS backwards as a way to change
your range quickly. You can QS forward and forward-diagonally to rotate and
re-orient simultaneously. Each QS variation is unique and only practice will
help you develop a sense of style. The QS is performed:

   (LT_RT) ~ (stick movement)

For those who are a bit confused, press the right or left turbo and then
press the direction you wish to QS. This differs from dash activation; you
press the stick movement before the turbo to activate a dash.

[1.3.4 Quick-Step Close-Combat]

In VOOM, a circle-slice was an auto-homing set distance rotation attack
which caused your opponent to "lose" their guard while you attacked them.
They had the choice to either jump, re-guard, or dash. In VOOT, Quick-Step
Close-Clombat (QS-CC) has replaced the circle-slice.

Activation is the same as the normal QS, except with the stick movement you
include a LW or RW activation.

   (LT_RT) ~ (stick movement left or right) + (LW_RW)

QS-CC can only be directed left or right. Also, unlike the circle-slice in
VOOM, the QS-CC doesn't auto-home to your opponent.

[1.3.5 Jumping Close-Combat]

Jumping Close-Combat can be used as a reversal to a uncancellable (or slowly
canceled) CC attack. When you jump, your VR auto-homes to your opposing
VR and then brings a CC attack crashing down upon the opponent's head.

    J ~ [w]

Jumping Close-Combat is guardable and ground-hit capable.

[1.3.6 Dashing Close-Combat]

Dashing Close-Combat is a guardable CC variation which can only be activated
during a forward or forward-diagonal dash:

    (stick movement opposite of dashing direction) + [w]

This means you either pull your stick directly backwards or backwards
diagonally in the opposite direction of the current dashing direction. Which
stick you pull decides which side you attack on. Also, dashing CC allows for
rotation; rotate in dashing CC to maximize your CC arc. Some dashing CC
attacks are ground-hit capable.

[1.3.7 Guard Reversals]

A Guard Reversal is almost exactly what its sounds like. While being
attacked, you can guard an attack. However, unless you perform a Guard
Reversal, the opponent attacking will happily use a chain, an unblockable
crouch attack, or even Quick-Step CC in an attempt to break your guard.

A Guard Reversal is the quickest type of attack available in VOOT. It is
performed by:

    Gr . [w]

Guard Reversal timing is very stringent. You must be IN your guard animation
before you can perform a Guard Reversal; otherwise, you will perform an
unblockable crouch attack. A Guard Reversal can also only be done with your
RW or LW. No matter what you may ever hear or think, there is NO GrCW.

Most Guard Reversals home very well (almost 180 degree/3.14 radian rotation
in some VRs) and do modest damage. However, they are uncancelable and often,
with lighter VR Guard Reversals, do not cause a knockdown.

//-----------------------//
//  1.5. ... cancelling  //
//-----------------------//

Every CC variation is cancellable into another move. However, not every
variation is cancellable by the same actions or throughout its entire
animation. The following chart is a guide to CC cancellation. Keep in mind
one can continue the cancels into infinite loops of inaction; however,
performing a series of cancels, while undoubtly looking cool, has no
tactical advantage.

//  1.6. ... this guide  //
//-----------------------//

All damages in this guide (unless otherwise specified) are performed against
a 0% V.Armour Dordray on Space Dock after the initial damage boost. Dordray
was selected because he has the best center of gravity.

Part II: The Temjin - MBV-707-G
=============================================================

//---------------------//
//  2.1. Introduction  //
//---------------------//

Often referred to as the "Ryu" of the Virtual-On series, Temjin is a very
aggressive "power" VR. Heavily dependent upon its Long Launcher and using
its Power Bomb for cover, Temjin can cause serious damage in both medium
range and CC.

In CC, Temjin's basic chains are extremely easy to master; however, they
have very little variation. Its basic CC range is extremely long and well
worth exploiting. The LW and QS-CC are definitely staples.

In short, Temjin is basically a middle-tier learners VR. You can use it to
pick up the basics of Virtual-On medium and long range combat.

//-----------------//
//  2.2. Basic CC  //
//-----------------//

[2.2.1 Basic Variations]

   LW (396)   +Cr (286) 59.9m   - Left-Right Quick Slice (Drop Kick Trip)
   RW (363)   +Cr (242) 69.9m   - Poke (Low Poke)
   CW (429)   +Cr (374) 99.9m   - Left-Right Slice (Unblockable Left-Right
                                    Slice)

[2.2.2 Turbo Variations]

RT+
   LW (451)     - Power Punch
   RW (478)     - Drop flip Right-Left Slice
   CW (500)     - Behind the back Left-Right Slice

[2.2.3 Quick Step CC]

          Direction
LT+   /  Left | Right \
      +---------------|
   LW |   1   |   1   |
   RW |   1   |   1   |

   LW |   1   |   1   |
   RW |   1   |   1   |
      \---------------/

1 - Temjin circles around the opposing VR, slicing with its Beam Sword.

[2.2.4 Jumping CC]

Temjin jumps and swings its Beam Sword above its head and smashes it down
upon the opposing VR.

 J+
   LW (440)     - More homing, more damage!
   RW (407)
   CW (407)

[2.2.5 Ground-Hit CC]

Temjin's ground-hit is of a normal speed; however, unless you're on bearing
with the opposing VR, it has a tendency to miss completely.

   RW (14.3%)   - Pokes its Beam Sword downwards into the fallen
                    opposing VR.

[2.2.6 Dashing CC]

Temjin's dashing CC is odd in that its LW and RW dashing CCs are not
symmetrical; instead, they represent different ends of the animation
spectrum. The LW dashing CC is much more pronounced and sweeps in a wide
arc. The RW dashing CC is very quick but also sweeps in a very tight angle.

   LW (330)     - Sweeps its Beam Sword in an arc left of its body.
   RW (330)     - Sweeps its Beam Sword in an arc right of its body.
   CW (456)     - Swings its Beam Sword above its head and down into the
                    opposing VR. (Ground-Hit Capable)

//-------------------------//
//  2.3. Chain and Combos  //
//-------------------------//

Temjin's chains are extremely simple two-hits which cause reasonable damage.
Use one of Temjin's Cr cancels instead of the second hit in a two-hit chain;
the Cr gives more damage and is unblockable.

[2.3.1 Basic Chains]

   LW  (396)    +Cr (286)  DOR  - Left-Right Quick Slice (Drop Kick Trip)
    LW (638)    +Cr (682)       - Right-Left Quick Slice ("")
    RW (583)    +Cr (638)       - Poke (Low Poke)
    CW    NA    +Cr (770)       - (Unblockable Left-Right Slice)

   RW  (363)    +Cr (242)  TEM  - Poke (Low Poke)
    LW (605)    +Cr (649)       - Left-Right Quick Slice (Drop Kick Trip)
    RW (550)    +Cr (605)       - Elbow Smash (Low Poke)
    CW    NA    +Cr (737)       - (Unblockable Left-Right Slice)

[2.3.2 Swallow's Tail]

Temjin's swallow's tails, similar to Temjin's other CC types, are straight
forward and normal. The RW dashing CC requires more stringent timing than
the LW due to their varying arcs.

   LW  (396)  DOR   - Left-Right Quick Slice
    LW (726)        - Sweeps its Beam Sword in an arc left of its body.
    RW (726)        - Sweeps its Beam Sword in an arc right of its body.
    CW (852)        - Swings its Beam Sword above its head and down into the
                        opposing VR.

   RW  (363)  TEM   - Poke
    LW (693)        - Sweeps its Beam Sword in an arc left of its body.
    RW (693)        - Sweeps its Beam Sword in an arc right of its body.
    CW (819)        - Swings its Beam Sword above its head and down into the
                        opposing VR.

[2.3.3 Shinku(u) Cancel]

Temjin has, arguably, has the "fairest" shinkuus in the game. Its CW shinkuu
is restricted to being an attack extension. Its RW shinkuu has great
countering and ground-hit effects. Finally, the LW shinkuu fullest effect
applies only to Dordray.

   LW (792)     Easy    Omni    - Cancel when Beam Sword is between 10-11:00
                                    (pre-hit) or 1-2:00 (post-hit) position.
   RW (726)     VHard   Omni    - Cancel when Beam Sword is at furthest
                                    extent.

//-----------------------//
//  2.4. LT Projectiles  //
//-----------------------//

Temjin's LTCW variations are the most damaging LT variation, long-range.
Depending on your angle in CC, it would be wiser to use the LTLW or LTRW for
their stun properties.

   LW (BBD)     +Cr (ANG)  DAM  - Bouncing Bomb (Launch Bomb)
   RW (DOR)     +Cr (GRY)  NDAM - Tapping Beam (Crouching Tapping Beam)
   CW (BBD)     +Cr (BBD)  DAM  - Fin Beam Sword (Crouching Fin Beam Sword)

=============================================================
Part III: The Raiden - HBV-502-H8 (RVR-75)
=============================================================

//---------------------//
//  3.1. Introduction  //
//---------------------//

If Temjin is the "Ryu" of Virtual-On, then Raiden is M.Bison. Arguably one
of the most powerful VR in middle and long-range combat, Raiden is not a VR
known for its extrodinary CC abilities but rather for its Screw Lasers.

However, Raiden can definately pack a serious punch and shock. Its CC
weapons have average speed and do enough damage to cause any player to
re-consider extended CC. Raiden's LW chains, while not the best in the
homing department, are winners in the damage world. Combined with a
COMBO-able instant-knockdown RW, Raiden's CC lends more to a hit and run
strategy.

Consider this section of the guide to be a good filler for a VR which isn't
designed for CC.

//-----------------//
//  3.2. Basic CC  //

[3.2.1 Basic Variations]

   LW (308)   +Cr (308) 74.9m   - Punch (Hyper Bazooka Bash)
   RW (385)   +Cr (264) 64.9m   - Hyper Bazooka Slap (Hyper Bazooka Leg Knee
                                    Bash)
   CW (500)   +Cr (418) 34.9m   - Electric Shock (Hyper Bazooka Lift)


[3.2.2 Turbo Variations]

RT+
   LW (286)     - Shoulder Ram

1 - Rotates around opposing VR and gut-punches them.
2 - Rotates around opposing VR and slaps them with its Hyper Bazooka.

[3.2.4 Jumping CC]

Using its Left and Right Weapons, Raiden jumps and slams its Hyper Bazooka
into the opposing VRs head. When using its Center Weapon, Raiden jumps and
"butt-bounces" into the opposing VR.

 J+
   LW (407)     - Raiden jumps and slams its Hyper Bazooka on to the
                    opposing VRs head.
   RW (407)     - "
   CW (484)     - Raiden jumps and "butt-bounces" on to opposing VR.

[3.2.5 Ground-Hit CC]

   RW (14.3%)   - Slams its Hyper Bazooka into the fallen opposing VR.

[3.2.6 Dashing CC]

   LW (412)     - Sweeps its Hyper Bazooka in an arc left of its body.
   RW (412)     - Sweeps its Hyper Bazooka in an arc right of its body.
   CW (500)     - Swings its Hyper Bazooka in an uppercut motion.

//-------------------------//
//  3.3. Chains and Combos //
//-------------------------//

Raiden's RW doesn't truly chain. The first RW hit knocks down, but the moves
can chain. The listed damages are for the moves alone. Add guard damage in a
"true" chain. :le sigh:

//  3.4. LT Projectiles  //
//-----------------------//

Raiden has a limited set of options in reference to CC LT variations. He has
only three useful options which can be used in two different situations.
(one does not preclude the other)

The CrLTLW is both damaging and offers excellent visual cover. It also has
very forgiving attack angles requiring you only to be within effective CC
range.

The LTRW and CrLTRW, while not damaging, both have stun properties and can
stop an opposing VRs attack and break their guard. The LTRW has more
forgiving attack angles and has a faster activation time. However, the
CrLTRW offers much better stun abilities. Be aware of your opponent's attack
angle, because the CrLTRW is best effective in the 12-2:30 arc.

Raiden's other CC LT variations are mostly useless. The LTLW does not deal
as much damage as the CrLTLW and is less cancellable. The LTCW variations do
not actually hit in CC!

Part IV: The Fei-Yen Kn - RVR-14
=============================================================

//---------------------//
//  4.1. Introduction  //
//---------------------//

She's stronger, faster, and more productive with a butt bounce included in
the deal. Magic song and crazy hearts everywhere makes Fei-Yen Kn a deadly VR.

In the Close Combat realm, Fei-Yen Kn has speed and style to make up for any
damage or (worse yet) armour difficulties. Not a strong VR, but definately
putting out more than you would guess from her size. Her chains are quick
enough to get two hits in and then try to cause the opposing VR to lose its
indicators.

Fei-Yen Kn can be a rush to play and definately an exercise in ones wits and
resourcefulness.

//-------------------------//
//  4.3. Chains and Combos //
//-------------------------//

Fei-Yen Kn has some extremely deadly combos. Her combos are fast and homing
enough to make any VR pilot think twice about going toe-to-toe. However, be
aware of which direction you enter with your slice, because it can impact
how quickly your CC hits. Combined quick QS and generous helpings of Guard
Reversals, and Fei-Yen Kn is a VR which can quickly deal some damage.

Unfortunately, generally, she's not considered a powerful VR. She doesn't
take damage as well as she can give, and Cypher is definately better CC
reach range-wise.

Enter CC with a solid strategy, however, and you will do well.

Part XIIV: Basic Strategies
=============================================================

//------------------------//
//  13.1. Chain Breaking  //
//------------------------//

CC chains are the most reliable way of causing the most damage against your
opposing VR. However, if you're the opposing VR caught in a chain, then
suddenly the damage potential doesn't seem as much of a positive as it did
when entering CC. Unfortunately, it's the inability to control CC which
scares many people away from it. These basic Chain Breaking strategies, when
used properly, will help you improve your close game and reduce the amount of
damage you receive in CC.

[13.1.1 Guarding]

Pro:
The easiest way to stop a chain from damaging you is to simply guard. While
guarding, any successful CC attack against you only does a low "guard
damage" percentile.

Con:
Unfortunately, while a relatively safe reaction to incoming attacks, a
simple guard performed against a competant opponent places you in a
tactically inferior position. Your opponent will notice your guard and
either immediately cause you to lose CC indicators or attempt a unblockable
CrCC attack.

Reality:
Once you've reached a certain level of skill, guarding should be your
solution of last resort and more advanced strategies are suggested.

[13.1.2 Guard Reversals]

Pro:
A Guard Reversal is typically a more aggressive method of breaking a chain
or even a QS-CC. Instead of taking a defensive posture which can place you
in a tactically inferior position, a Guard Reversal gives you the
opportunity of punishing your opponent for using a chain or being overly
predictable.

Con:
Unfortunately, if your opponent successfully guards your Guard Reversal,
you're left in a significant freeze animation which cannot be cancelled;
allowing your opponent to counter-attack at their leisure.

Reality:
A Guard-Reversal is a useful and quick attack; however, be extrememly
careful at with its usage. It's better to be in a tactically inferior
position than on the ground from having taken a RTCW CC attack.

[13.1.3 Quick-Step]

Pro:
A QS is a good mixture of aggresiveness and defensiveness in responding to a
CC chain. A QS allows you to completely avoid your opponents attack, causes
them to lose indicators on you, and at the same time places you in a perfect
position for a counter-attack.

Con:
Be careful with your Quick-Steps. While rapdily Quick-Stepping, trying to
confuse your opponent, it's extremely easy to accidently place yourself in a
tactically inferior position and be punished for it by your opponent. Also,
many VRs attacks only allow for one direction of Quick-Stepping; the wrong
direction causing a full on weapon-VR collision.

Reality:
If you know what your opponent is going to do, more power to you. In
VOOT, the odds for Quick-Stepping to the left are better than the
right. However, be aware of a few RT attacks which hit omni-directionally.

[13.1.4 Quick-Step CC Counter]

Pro:
While not as intimidating as a QS followed up with a normal CC attack, a
QS-CC counter can often be much more tactically sound. The QS-CC has
directional homing and is much harder for an opponent to use a dash-cancel
to avoid.

Con:
A well timed Guard-Reversal should be your greatest fear. It can knock a VR
right out of a QS-CC and is often extremely hard to see coming. However,
assuming good timing and the correct direction, there really aren't many
cons to the QS-CC counter. Be ready to cancel in case your opponent
successfully avoids the QS-CC.

Reality:
One of the better methods to countering a chain or most forms of CC. Use it
wisely.

[13.1.5 Jumping CC Counter]

Pro:
It's flashy, deals good damage, and extremely hard to counter. It's similar
to a Guard-Reversal in advantages, except you can't (as easily) counter
QS-CC.

Con:
Exactly like a Guard-Reversal: If your opponent sees it coming, or worse,
guards it, you've got a serious problem in the shape of an uncancellable
freeze animation.

Reality:
Sleepy players won't see it coming, but it's most effective on a cocky
"professional" whiffing an unblockable CrCC attack. Punish them and feel
good about it.

Of course, there are the ones who didn't intend to support it, but did
unintentionally:

My parents, BCA Games, Green River Community College (all roads end here),
McCarl, and the Lindbloom Student Center's VOOM cabinet, Gameworks of
Seattle, Southern Hills Golfland of Stanton, and Illusionz of Issaquah.

I'm sure I've forgotten you, and for that I'm dreadfully sorry. Throughout
