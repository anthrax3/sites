   <TITLE>[VOOT] Interview with the Developers</TITLE>
   <!-- God damn Netscape with it's stupid uppercasing of the HTML tags -->
</HEAD>
<BODY>

<P>This is how the developers created the still-deepening and widely-being
played &amp; loved world of Oratorio Tangram. What we could do is just
see it as played like the eyeball of Tangram. Here is an interview where
Juro Watari, the producer of Oratorio Tangram, which stocked the arcade
world in many ways, answered questions all Oratori Tangram players demanded
to be answered. </P>

<H2>This is the way Watari observed the National Tournament of VOOT</H2>

<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Interviewer:</TD>

<TD>So, please let me hear your overall impression of the national tournament
that took place a few days ago. </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Watari:</TD>

<TD>I'm very impressed to see how far some players were able to go in terms
of skill and technique. I was very satisfied. </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Interviewer:</TD>

<TD>You've told me before that Temjin would be the strongest VR, and we
witnessed what you said came true, didn't we? </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Watari:</TD>

<TD>Oh, it was his [E.K.D's] skill that made it possible. What amazed me
especially was the footwork used to move behind Angelan and evade her ice
barrier. It was very technical. </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Interviewer:</TD>

<TD>What did you feel about the strategies the other players in the tournament
took? </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Watari:</TD>

<TD>I, personally, wanted to enjoy a shooting game; and, on this point,
they amused me very much, and I appreciate it. (<I>Scott</I>: Satoru originally
used &quot;<I>succeeded to amuse</I>&quot; instead of &quot;<I>pleased</I>&quot;.)
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<H2>The Controversial Game Balance</H2>

<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Interviewer:</TD>

<TD>
The &quot;Virtual-On&quot; series experienced a lot of changes with VOOT,
but this also caused more than a few (<i>Scott</i>: Originally &quot;not a few&quot;
this phrase is used often) players to feel a slight sense of disappointment.
Let me hear more of these stories, please? </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Watari:</TD>

<TD>I hope I can answer as many of your questions as possible. </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Interviewer:</TD>

<TD>My first point is the game balance, because quite a few players are
having the feeling a restriction in terms of VR unbalance. </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Watari:</TD>

<TD>Could you tell me, specifically, about what unbalance they think this
game has? </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Interviewer:</TD>

<TD>This VR is no match against this VR and such. For example: Temjin and
Apharmed BT can never win against a Specineff who keeps escaping all the
rounds. This kind of mismatching problem is one point. Also, the features
of some stages give high advantage to a VR, and disadvantage to the other,
don't they? </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Watari:</TD>

<TD>I've got your point. </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Interviewer:</TD>

<TD>The field bias might may be so problematic because some players overcome
this kind of disadvantage with technique and skill; however, certain strategies
with certain VRs create a desparate situation for which some VRs are almost
undefeatable. This is one of the reasons for the confusion I mentioned.
And, some highly skilled players are suffering from this problem. </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Watari:</TD>

<TD>I don't think the present game balance is permanent. For example, the
common play style of OMG four months after the release of the game was
obsolete when the national tournament took place in Spring of 1998. </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Interviewer:</TD>

<TD>Yes, I agree. </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Watari:</TD>

<TD>Suppose the game balance has not been fixed after more than one year,
then I will admit there must be a generic problem in this game. However,
I don't think there is, if the rumored game balance is shifting every half
a year. I'd rather consider other reasons, say the interface of the game:
like the strength of levers and the volume of input, or maybe it is caused
by players' mental abilities. </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Interviewer:</TD>

<TD>For example?</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Watari:</TD>

<TD>This might be called &quot;drifting phase.&quot; A die is considered
to be a cube and we expect that the probability of the outcomes when one
is thrown be evenly one out of six; but, sometimes, we have the same outcomes
continuously. So, the conclusion about the game balance may have been drawn
from the fact players' have been sticking to one stragegy too long.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Interviewer:</TD>

<TD>Then the prevailing playing style is the cause?</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Watari:</TD>

<TD>That is one possibility. The intention to create a certain balance
will trap us in a situation where we have to add artificially more and
more restrictions to this game, like rensyo hosei (<I>Satorou</I>: a penalty
imposed on players in the game who win continuously, or an auto balancing
system).</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Interviewer:</TD>

<TD>What kind of problem do you think it creates?</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Watari:</TD>

<TD>I&nbsp;suppose players may become distressed because of a feeling of
more imposition from the developers. Our developing team also knew this
claim would occur before the release, and we tried to implement the game
so as not to cause a sense of inbalance. I woudn't say we minimized it.
I can say only, comparatively, we tried to drop the level of unfairness
as much as possible.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Interviewer:</TD>

<TD>I can only imagine how difficult it is to moderate the game balance
&quot;Virtual-On&quot; needs.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Watari:</TD>

<TD>For instance, the relative locations of VRs are not exactly the same.
It may appear to be the same, but it is not completely the same, so the
result of a game inevitably varies. There are more chance factors, so the
result may differ from what the player expected; but neither will unnecessary
modificaitons be what they want. </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<H2>Users' Play Style and Game Balance</H2>

<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Interviewer:</TD>

<TD>
I understand that the current game balance might be temporary, but I think
more consideration on those with an escaping stragegy or machi
(waiting/chicken) style would let players avoid having only one fixed and
optimized stragegy. Don't you think so?
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Watari:</TD>

<TD>
It is true that whether players take the escaping stragegy or not is
thoroughly in the hands of the players themselves. I also admit that the
tuning of the game is weak on this point. This game was not made to reward
you chasing even though your opponent keeps escaping far, far, far away.  I
have to concede this is the limitation imposed to players. We, as
developers, are to some extent negative to the thought that chasing those
escaping (<i>Satoru</i>: implying chicken) players make a good and enjoyable
game. Our starting point is the place where both two players agree on their
playing style with at least 60% aggressiveness. So we didn't make much
concern about escaping and this is one point that we have to review.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Interviewer:</TD>

<TD>

In the OMG, it seemed that <b>some</b> players concluded they should seek more
possibilities of this game by admitting any kinds of playstyle rather than
limitting it. (<i>Satoru</i>: to close combat) The same argument has
recurred in VOOT.

<br>&nbsp;<br>

(<i>Scott</i>: Satoru's translation wasn't too clear on this point. I think
I cleared it up and got the gist of it, though.)
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Watari:</TD>

<TD>
I can hope this argument will be concluded on at some point and time too,
can't I?
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Interviewer:</TD>

<TD>
Here's the point the previous story comes in: players are definitely allowed
to escape in this game, and indeed, more than a few players take this kind
of strategy. If you underestimate this problem, then I'm afraid the players'
opinion was not acknowledged by the developing team.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Watari:</TD>

<TD>
Um, I think this is a misunderstanding in a sense. We did simulate what
would happen if a player escaped whole, say, 90 seconds. And when we assumed
a player running away in a direction, we could say &quot;Oh, I see, this is the
point where we should put some blocks&quot;. But we wondered if this is a good
solution. I'm afraid my word &quot;negative&quot; confused you too. I'm not saying
that escaping equals bad or escaping equals unpreferable, but what I meant
was it is just absurd to &quot;correct&quot; or &quot;prohibit&quot; actions in this genre of
videogame. It is true that we must reconsider this problem if Specineff
continues to be, by far, the strongest until the release in Dreamcast. This
may also be a temporary and non-generic problem discovered in the process of
this game maturing and the problem overcomed as time goes by. Speaking of
balance, using only Temjin will give players the complete fairness. Then why
are there unique VRs and fun VRs? Well, some will let you win easily, and
some will require much effort which leads you to a satisfactory game.  We've
created this variety of VRs in terms of this kind of characterization.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Interviewer:</TD>

<TD>
And we can see that characterization by comparing Apharmd ST and Fei-Yen
Kn's VR ranking history, huh?

<br>&nbsp;<br>

(<i>Satoru</i>: I don't know about ST, but
Fei-Yen was said to be one of the strongest VRs for a few months after the
release of VOOT, which later turned out to be false.)

(<i>Scott</i>: Satoru used to wipe the Seattle scene's floor with our VRs
against his ST.)
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Watari:</TD>

<TD>
This is why I need at least one year to finalize my thoughts on the balance
of this this game. No way I can say &quot;OK, this is a problem, I'll fix this.&quot;
It is my responsibility not to do so. In other words, I would be very
irresponsible to rush to a conclusion by judging the current conditions.

<H2>New Features In Oratorio Tangram</H2>

<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Interviewer:</TD>

<TD>
Let me move onto the next topic, which is somehow related to the game
balance. Why did you give &quot;rowing&quot; (<i>Satoru</i>: kogu(v) kogi(n) - a VOOT
jargon meaning moving two levers back and forth rapidly to make VR
move/slide very fast. Seen clearly in Angelan and Specineff, the new 2 VRs)
factor to many VRs? Rowing has got to be very important indeed, hasn't it?
To be honest, Angelan and Specineff are overwhelmingly strong where this
technique is concerned, and some players are complaining why some can, and
some can't.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Watari:</TD>

<TD>
Hmm. It is possible to &quot;row&quot; all VRs.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Interviewer:</TD>

<TD>
Oh, is it so?
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Watari:</TD>

<TD>
The only difference is that some are easy to row and &quot;others&quot; are not. The
&quot;others&quot; require player inputs beyond human ability (<i>Satoru</i>: =P), so
only some are considered to be rowable. 
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Interviewer:</TD>

<TD>
Then, why so many VRs are allowed to be rowed in VOOT?
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Watari:</TD>

<TD>
The twin stick of VOOT has been made to be sensitive enough in order to
recognize player's input more accurately, and this lowered the level which
divided rowable and unrowable. This led to so many VRs being rowable.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Interviewer:</TD>

<TD>
Well, so many people are complaining about this because it is unreasonably
hard to hit a rowing Spefineff or Angelan. By the way, taking (<i>Scott</i>:
???) of Ajim, why did you create that enormously strong VR?
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Watari:</TD>

<TD>
Oh, Ajim was a joke character.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Interviewer:</TD>

<TD>
A joke?
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Watari:</TD>

<TD>
When you are playing Mahjong, you must have seen some jerk players Pon and
Che-ing without consideration to other fellows, haven't you?
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Interviewer:</TD>

<TD>
Yes?
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Watari:</TD>

<TD>
In VOOT too, I thought it would be fun to have a jerk character.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Interviewer:</TD>

<TD>
Hmm, it seems Ajim is not so widely accepted character according to the
interview. Indeed, I had a chance to talk with more than 100 players, this
time, but there was only one self-proclaimed Ajim user in them.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Watari:</TD>

<TD>
Oh, I think it is because of the outlook towar Ajim. Well those
inconsiderate players will be soon neglected. However, it is true that those
kinds of people are out in the world... and I let there be a disgusting
character in the world of VOOT (<i>Satoru</i>: to mimic the real world). Of
course, there might be some people who try to play this game seriously, and
they would think Ajim is unacceptable. But not all players expect this game
to have the same kind of 100 yen (<i>Satoru</i>: approximately 80 cent)
worth of fun, and I think it very important to let a videogame have various
kinds of fun factors players can enjoy.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Interviewer:</TD>

<TD>
But those who take VOOT as a fun like sports, where fair games are
guaranteed, must be resentful about this feature.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Watari:</TD>

<TD>
I understand the stoicism some players uphold. When thinking of the whole
arcade business, I believe it interesting to argue on how common the core
players' playing style is in one videogame. At least in VOOT, I left room
for the freedom of choice to some degree. Yes, it is totally up to players.
But don't be rushy and enjoy Ajim, because we see a lot of jerk people like
Ajim. (<i>Satoru</i>: =p)
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<H2>Auto Balancing and Arcade Games</H2>

<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Interviewer:</TD>

<TD>
So, what do you think about the auto balancing system, the so called
<i>rensyo-hosei</i>?
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Watari:</TD>

<TD>
Hmm, every arcade videogame has an auto balancing system.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Interviewer:</TD>

<TD>
Yes, that is true. But a lot of eager players who want to get better, in a true
sense, seem to want to create serious games out of their own skill instead
of auto-balancing to have more fun.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Watari:</TD>

<TD>
I see. However, if the idea is serious, their demand is something beyond
what I can deal with with the current coin operation. One fundamental idea
is that our videogames are not just for players, but our first clients, or
operators. We have to satisfy the demanding condition where both the players
of a videogame and the buyers of the videogame are satisfied. It is true
the priority is to the players, who actually pay 100 yen for a game, but we
absolutely cannot neglect operators as well. It might be hard to have this
idea accepted without argument, but there is a certain line that clearly
divides developers, operators, and players. True, it is tough problem to
explain.

<br>&nbsp;<br>

(<i>Satoru</i>: <b>coin operation</b> - Japanese & English - it's a jargon I
don't think is so common, meaning arcade business, I guess)
<br>
(<i>Scott</i>: I frequently interact with operators and distributors. It's
definately industry jargon, though in the States there is the seperation between
&quot;arcade&quot;/&quot;coin vender&quot; and &quot;console.&quot;)
<br>
(<i>Satoru</i>: He uses operators just like gameshops. Gameworks in Seattle
is also an operator refered to by this term.)
<br>
(<i>Scott</i>: I don't know how much it is like this in Japan, but in the
States &quot;operators&quot; must first purchase or, more frequently, cost-share from
&quot;distributors.&quot; The &quot;distributors&quot; handle the importation issues and
maintain a stock. I imagine in Japan &quot;operators&quot; more often purchase
directly from the manufacturer due to less issues.)
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Interviewer:</TD>

<TD>
But your words would make large difference, and I believe some players will
understand what you mean.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Watari:</TD>

<TD>
Some people might say it is an excuse, and I must apologize for this. This
is really tough point.
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<H2>Why VOOT Was Developed</H2>

<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Interviewer:</TD>

<TD>
So let me go back to a basic point. Why did you make thorough changes, such
as the innovation on the controlling system, even though you expected some
rejection from the players of OMG?
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Watari:</TD>

<TD>
Firstly, OMG was meant to have highly stoic gameplay. So, the game has been
completed in a sense. Considering that, I thought it was natural to change
the orientation when new world was created. Making something much like OMG
would make OMG meaningless. So, we wanted to make it up to the players. If
they prefer OMG, they should play it; if they like to play VOOT, then
they've got it. So VOOT is not meant to be a cutoff from the previous
version.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Interviewer:</TD>

<TD>
But in fact, it is hard to find OMG downtown, isn't it?
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Watari:</TD>

<TD>
This might be also a misconveyance of our concept. If our idea was accepted,
some operators would have installed these two videogames in parallel. In
fact, more than a few operators did so in the beginning. However, I
understand it is hard for them to do so.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Interviewer:</TD>

<TD>
It is kind of itchy not to be understood completely by operators and
players, isn't it?
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Watari:</TD>

<TD>

Certainly. By the way, I am frequently asked about the meaning of Tangram,
which is officially, "Tangram, regulating system of chrono-space
cause-result chain" (<i>Satoru</i>: It is hard to go translate what he
meant. It's an oriental philosophical term) but my feeling is just like
Tangram.

<br>&nbsp;<br>

(<i>Scott</i>: Tangram -
<br>
Space Time Causation Control Mechanism
<br>
Pan Dimensional Reality Synthesizer 
<br>
You'll notice the interviewer also didn't understand.)
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Interviewer:</TD>

<TD>
What do you mean?
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Watari:</TD>

<TD>
The storyline of VOOT has not revealed officially yet, but the game is about
a chaotic conflict between DNA and RNA sides. In the real world, some people
would like OMG rather than VOOT. I imagined, before the release of VOOT,
that VOOT will be a challenge for OMG players. Some players would say "I'm
OK with OMG, but I'll never play VOOT again". What I can do is just keep
watching how VOOT is accepted by some of them after the release, just like
the Tangram's eyeball.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Interviewer:</TD>

<TD>
So, VOOT isn't a cutoff.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Watari:</TD>

<TD>
Never. Nor do I say "Ok, done. Just do this videogame. I don't care what you
think about this though." Instead, I'm saying "I will take care of these two
games like Tangram's eyeball." Yeah, it sometimes beams you up.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Interviewer:</TD>

<TD>
It does extend its hands, too.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Watari:</TD>

<TD>
Right. Though its punch never hits. I want the players to know I do have
some idea.

<H2>A Comment to All VOOT Players</H2>

<TABLE>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Interviewer:</TD>

<TD>
So, please give a comment to all VOOT players.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Watari:</TD>

<TD>
In a sense, I'm afraid that we didn't have a correct vision. SEGA is
basically trying to produce as many as possible rather easy-going
videogames, but since the release of "Virtua Fighter II", some people have
started to formulate a different way to play a videogame. Videogames turned
out to have an aspect of so-called self-training or self-seeking tool which
some players try to reflect themselves in, and I don't think this should be
under-rated. This is a very recent trend, so we still don't know how to
respond to it. However, I somehow doubt this kind of videogame will be
widely accepted.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Interviewer:</TD>

<TD>
What do you mean?
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Watari:</TD>

<TD>
Well, "Beat Mania" (<i>Satoru</i>: Konami) is popular out there in arcades.
A lot of people like the kind of videogames that are easily playable and
enjoyable with other people and friends, so I wonder if it is worth while
continuing to create off-trend games. I wonder if current operators need
products dedicated to core players when I think of the three layers of
developers, operators, and players. "Gradius" (<i>Satoru</i>: Konami, also)
made a legend in old arcade history, but the sales of it were not so
successful for its legendary story. We know that some people are really into
this kind of game. (<i>Satoru</i>: for core gamers) But the percentage of
the videogames those core players are likely to play is very small,
considering whole the world of arcade games. It is something beyond the
ability of a videogame company's business to make core players' games. But
of course, we surely try to do our best. (<i>Satoru</i>: to satisfy eager
core-players)
