I'm not one who is very big on README files. Rather, here is the simple
process of installing DCDL. Make sure you're downloaded and/or patched the
tools listed in the header of dcdl.pl.

1) Decompress your DCDL archive (dcdl-?.?.tar.*) into a random directory.
    (~/dcdl/)

2) Create the directory you want on your webserver to host a DCDL Archive.
    (~/public_html/dcdl/)

3) Create the DCDL "work" directory. This can be shared between multiple
    DCDL archives. (~/public_html/dcdl/work/)

4) Create the DCDL "data" directory. This holds the .VMS files for your DCDL
    archive. (~/public_html/dcdl/data/)

5) Create the following symbolic links:
	~/public_html/dcdl/dcdl.pl -> ~/dcdl/dcdl.pl
    ~/public_html/dcdl/.htaccess -> ~/dcdl/.htaccess

6) Create a symbolic link to the proper XT handler:
	~/public_html/dcdl/dir.xt -> ~/dcdl/basic.xt

7) Configure your ~/dcdl/dcdl.pl file with the proper directory locations.

8) Configure your ~/dcdl/clean-dcdl-work with the proper directory locations.

9) Add the following line to your crontab:
        5 0 * * *       ~/dcdl/clean-dcdl-work

10) Congratulations! You've probably just installed DCDL! If there are any
     problems, try to figure them out on your own. If you get real
     desperate, e-mail me at scott_vo@quadhome.com.
